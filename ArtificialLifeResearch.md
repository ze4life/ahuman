Artificial Life research applies biological research results (see [BiologicalLifeResearch](BiologicalLifeResearch.md)) to aHuman unified mind model.
Approach of implementing aHuman project is to reuse fundamental architecture of aHuman brain with all essential circuits and components. This page and its subpages define unified artificial mind model.

# Artificial Mind Overview #

**Biological mind can be modeled using set of cortices, nuclei, ganglia, glands and bundles of fibers**:

  * cortices and nuclei receive, process and relay information
  * ganglia connect nuclei with muscles and glands, except for conscious motor connections which are direct from nuclei to muscles
  * glands produce peptides to affect wide brain areas or hormones to affect body via blood system
  * fibers connect brain components to each other

**Bundles of fibers connecting different pairs of components are grouped in tracts**:

  * tracts can go in the same direction to a long distance
  * fibers transfer fast signals as ion waves and mechanically transport molecular structures containing neurotransmitters and neuromodulators which affect connectivity between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons
  * various types of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators exert different influence on connectivity and signal relay from one neuron to another
  * nuclei and fibers using specific neurotransmitter build global network which serves some generic function like motivation, inhibition or relaxation and so on
  * when responding to specific stimuli, certain subsets of brain components behave as functional circuits with feedback and feedforward connections, which implements network firmly solving specific task in dynamic non-stationary environment

**Artifical Mind is modeled using MindArea, MindRegion and link objects**:
  * [MindArea](MindArea.md) is a group of mind components, defined by biological research.
  * [MindRegion](MindRegion.md) is artificial representation of brain component of one of 3 types - cortex, nucleus or gland
  * [MindAreaLink](MindAreaLink.md) corresponds to the tract and plays as signal transmission controller
  * [MindRegionLink](MindRegionLink.md) represents bundle of fibers having specific properties of component-to-component mapping and also can be of different types depending on transmitter used

# Formula of Artificial Life #

  * **"human"** =: **"intelligent"** **"alive being"**
    * **"intelligent"** =: having **"partially predefined"** **"complex memory"**
      * **"partially predefined"** =: "phyletic memory"
      * **"complex memory"** =: having **"specific structure"** and **"specific connectivity"**
        * **"specific structure"** =: "signal/noice logic", "holographic memory", "spatial and temporal memory"
        * **"specific connectivity"** =: "two-way cortex memory", "memory processor circuit"
    * **"alive being"** =: **"broadly non-linear"** **"adaptive"** **"self"**
      * **"broadly non-linear"** =: "having great depth"
      * **"adaptive"** =: "having environment-dependent behavior"
      * **"self"** =: **"embodied"** **"integrated circuits"**
        * **"embodied"** =: "having personal motivators"
        * **"integrated circuits"** =: "hierarchically connected circuits"

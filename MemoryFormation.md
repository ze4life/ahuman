Memory Prediction research covers using HTM/Memory Prediction theory for memorizing and recognizing complex patterns, produce internal representation.

## Terms ##

  * **short-term memory** - lasts for max 18 seconds
  * **long-term memory** - lasts for day or years (undergo forgetting process) - declarative and procedural
  * **declarative memory** - all memories that are consciously available - episodic and semantic
  * **episodic memory** - memory for specific events in time
  * **semantic memory** - knowledge about the external world
  * **procedural memory** - how to perform certain motor behaviour

## Long-term memory (LTM) ##

as per [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory):
  * **declarative memory** - encoded by hippocampus (also by enthorinal and perirhinal) but consolidated somewhere else - probably in temporal cortex
  * **procedural memory** - encoded and probably stored in cerebellum / striatum
  * **emotional memory** - related to amygdala

## Sensory Neocortex ##

  * recognize and predict functions, as per Jeff Hawkins
  * long-term memory formation by hippocampus - how it is related to neocortex?
  * do we have short-term memory in neocortex?

**Current Understanding**:
  * information is supplied by discrete events (not as ongoing flow) - e.g. saccades, which supply fragmentary information to visual neocortex 3 times per second
  * neocortex holds generalization structures, averaged perceived information, not episodic memory
  * association cortex and frontal cortex (holds feelings) supply feedback via cingulate gyrus to sensory cortex and hippocampus
    * associations and emotionally stressed data are stored easier
  * temporal cortex (TC) lies between visual sensory cortex (VC) and hippocampus (HC)
    * LTM is not stored by hippocampus, but hippocampus is absolutely required to create LTM as per HM patient
    * hippocampus is not required to keep short-term memory (18 seconds)
    * most appropriate place for LTM is temporal cortex
    * VC perceives primary sensory information and transforms to stable internal representation
    * VC -> TC flow supplies flow of internal representations, or signal of inability to recognize/predict; TC -> VC is unclear
    * HC -> TC flow represents control of memorising by hippocampus

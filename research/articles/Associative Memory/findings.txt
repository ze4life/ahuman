frontal cortex / frontal lobe
	temporal context
	temporal order
	memory of the source of facts
	events
	metamemory

prefrontal cortex / lateral prefrontal cortex
	manipulates and organizes to-be-remembered information
	devises strategies for retrieval
	monitors the outcome temporal cortex
	executive control of memory retrieval
	temporal-order retrieval

association cortex / inferior temporal (IT) cortex
	characteristics
		represents declarative knowledge and experiences, stores long-term declarative memory
		forms associations between semantically linked visual objects
		involved in sensory perception
		unimodal neocortex
		final stage of object vision
	parts
		temporal cortex (TE area)
			visual long-term memory storehouse
			TE mostly represents the sought target that is retrieved from long-term memory
		limbic cortex (A36)
			limbic polymodal association area
			retains both the cue stimulus and the sought target

medial temporal lobe
	severe amnesia if lesions
	hippocampus and adjacent regions
		Enthorinal cortex
		CA1 region
		CA3 region
		Dentate gyrus
	A36

TE -> A36
	create association between the representations of semantically linked objects
	create association between the representation of the paired associates

memorizing and remembering
	medial temporal lobe
	temporal cortex
	frontal cortex

automatic retrieval signals
	backward from the medial temporal lobe during the automatic retrieval process
	supported by signal created in IT cortex

active retrieval signals
	conveyed as a top-down signal from the prefrontal cortex to the temporal cortex during the active retrieval process
	prefrontal cortex -> IT cortex

‘global network’ viewpoint
‘local circuit’ viewpoint

short-term memory: pattern active until another is presented
long-term memory: persistent synaptic changes


Active waking - current opinion in neurobiology:
	1. afferent input (enthorinal cortex -> dentate gyrus) - activity patterns in layer II of EC heteroassociated with CA3 patterns
	5. self-organization (enthorinal cortex -> CA1) - CA1 activity patterns determined by direct afferent input from layer III of EC
----------------------------
in hippocampus:
	2. self-organization (dentate gyrus -(mossy fibre inputs)> CA3) - pattern determination
	3. auto-association recall (CA3: 2,8 -> 3,4) - pyramidal cells (PC) activity, hebbian modification of recurrent connections
	4. hetero-associative recall (CA3 -> CA1) - heterassociation with the active CA3 PCs through Hebbian modification of the Schaffer collateral synapses
	x. comparison (CA1: 4,5,8 -> 6,7)
	6. self-organization (CA3 -> dentate gyrus)
----------------------------
	7. regulation of learning dynamics (medial septum <-> CA1)
	8. regulation of learning dynamics (medial septum <-> CA3)

long-term memory formation:
	active waking:
		rapid encoding (information from environment -> intermediate-term episodic representation)
			excitatory connections between CA3 pyramids are strengthened that are activated by the event
			re-activation of the stored representations including spread of activity across the strengthened excitatory connections
	quiet waking:
		further strengthening of CA3-CA3 and CA3-CA1 connections
			activation of neurons representing the event in EC5 and association neocortex
		slower strengthening of the excitatory associative synaptic connections between neurons representing these features in neocortex
	finally:
		formation of links between these neurons that could be described as semantic or long-term episodic memories in neocortex
		consolidation does not neccessarily result in formation of links in association neocortex, 
			but could instead result in strengthening of representations within hippocampus itself or within the EC

perception: context -> features -> elaborated features
recognition: sequence of elaborated features -> objects
associate: features and objects
activate: associated features -> context

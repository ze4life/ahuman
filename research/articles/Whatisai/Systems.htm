<p class='vspace'>&quot;It is an interesting time to be an AI researcher. Computer speeds and capacities have increased to the point that tasks that used to take days can now be done in seconds. The pervasive role of computers in everyday life has emphasized the need for people and computers to co-exist and, one hopes, complementrather than hinder each other. Within the field of AI itself, we now have a solid understanding of many of he core issues. AI concepts like search, planning, learning, natural language, and so on have mature theoretical underpinnings and extensive practical histories. In many cases we understand just how hard some of these problems are to solve, and in these cases we often have a good understanding of how approximate solutions can be found and what the tradeoffs are in using them.Supported by these two trends, it is now possible to build AI systems that actually perform tasks that people find difficult (and that require intelligence, however exactly you define it) in reasonable amounts of time.&quot;<br />- <a target='_blank'  href='#trips'>George Ferguson and James Allen</a>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>An AI system is an orchestrated performance, not unlike a Broadway musical. Both come to life as the result of the choreographed interplay of diverse parts. In the theater, the music and words, scenery nd lighting, actors and dancers, all interact to create a purposeful experience. Similarly, the system hardware of your desktop PC sets the stage on which software technologies such as voice recognition, web access, text-to-speech, and 3-D image generators, perform their roles as directed by a complex computer program. The choice of a programming language also has its theatrical counterpart. The decision as to whether the concept should be embodied within a musical, an opera, or drama, obviously sets parameters for what can and cannot be done.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The choice to write it in English, French, Spanish or Italian will determine how many of the cast, crew and audience will understand it without translation, and if translation is provided, will meaning be lost. A programmer faces similar decisions when choosing a programming language. The language must be capable of representing the necessary concepts and it must be able to be understood by the other system components. After all, you wouldn't use a language developed for robot navigation to program a system designed to decode music...or would you ? 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>And just as advancements in construction and acoustics changed the shape of theater architecture, and the introduction of wireless microphones made possible new staging options, the universe of systems and languages is evolving on every level such that it offers increasingly spectacular performances. For example:

A Letter from the Editor, James Hendler. <a target='_blank'  class='urllink' href='http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/mags/ex/&amp;toc=http://csdl2.computer.org/comp/mags/ex/2005/03/x3toc.xml' rel='nofollow'>IEEE Intelligent Systems</a> (May / June 2005; 20 (3): 2-4). &quot;Think of the difference between the system of equations describing computation, the computing system hardware designed to bring those to reality, and the operating system software that makes the whole thing run. These different meanings are connected to a problem we computer scientists face when explaining what we do to those outside our field. ... Where does this confusion come from? I think the word 'systems' is partly to blame. It entered our field through our roots in cybernetics and control, before the computer, as we know it today, came into existence. As a result, we refer to 'systems' at virtually every level of our endeavor from 'systems administrator' to 'systems theory.' ... [I]f we look closely at these articles [in this issue], at least one theme emerges. It arises from the understanding that a system is, as dictionary.com defines it, 'A group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements forming a complex whole.' In each article,we see not the explicit interaction of these parts but the demonstration of techniques that can be used not just in the system being described but also more widely.&quot;

By Steve Jurvetson. Technology Review (July 11, 2006). &quot;Many of the most interesting problems in computer science, nano-technology, and synthetic biology require the construction of complex systems. But how would we build a really complex system -- such as a general artificial intelligence (AI) that exceeded human intelligence? Some technologists advocate design; others prefer evolutionary search algorithms. Still others would conflate the two, hoping to incorporate the best of both while avoiding their limitations. But while both processes are powerful, they are very different and not easily combined. Rather, they present divergent paths.&quot;

A new one every week. By Brian Hayes. American Scientist Online (July - August 2006). &quot;Programming languages are usually classified in four families. Imperative languages are built on commands: do this, do that, do the next thing. The commands act on stored data, modifying the overall state of the system. The imperative approach was the default in most early programming languages, including Fortran, cobol and Algol. Functional programming began with Lisp, although most versions of Lisp allow other styles of programming as well. John Backus, the lead developer of Fortran and a contributor to Algol, later became an advocate of functional languages. Several 'pure' functional languages have emerged since then, including ML, Miranda and Haskell. In object-oriented programming languages the root idea is to bind together imperative commands and the data they act on, forming encapsulated objects. Instead of defining a procedure to manipulate a data structure, one 'teaches' the data structure how to carry out operations on itself. Most object-oriented languages also have some notion of inheritance, whereby an object is born already knowing default behaviors. The object-oriented languages trace their heritage back to SIMULA 67, but they began to attract attention only in the 1980s with Smalltalk. ... The languages of the fourth category are variously known as logic, relational or declarative languages. What they have in common is the idea of programming not by spelling out step-by-step algorithms but by stating facts or relations. The best-known exemplar of this technique is Prolog, which relies on an method called unification to make deductions from stated facts. ... In the chronology of programming languages, Lisp comes from the very dawn of time. It was conceived nearly 50 years ago by John McCarthy, now of Stanford University.&quot; <em>Be sure to enlarge the image  on page 1: A Chronology of Selected Programming Languages. </em>

At 4 million operations per second and 4 kilobytes of memory, the 80386 gave PCs as much speed and power as older mainframes and minicomputers. The 386 chip brought with it the introduction of a 32-bit architecture, a significant improvement over the 16-bit architecture of previous microprocessors. It had two operating modes, one that mirrored the segmented memory of older x86 chips, allowing full backward compatibility, and one that took full advantage of its more advanced technology. The new chip made graphical operating environments for IBM PC and PC-compatible computers practical.&quot;

In current research, is AI research being programmed on top of exisiting operating systems, and basically are programs running on top of other programs?

By Charles Sheehan. Associated Press / available from USA Today (April 8, 2004). &quot;Researchers in robotics have traditionally faced two debilitating obstacles: terribly expensive parts and difficulty attracting funding from anyone outside of a small corps of true believers. But the field could be in line for a major jolt. Robotics experts see a 'perfect storm' heading their way, thanks in no small part to the human ravages of war. Just as the constant march of technology is driving down the cost of key components, top universities in robotics are reporting major increases in federal funding, with the Defense Department the biggest spender. ... At the same time, the materials that comprise the most technologically advanced components in robots, from optics to software, are becoming 'dirt cheap,' said Dan Kara, who covers the industry for <em>Robotics Trends</em>. Technology that lets robots perceive and overcome obstacles has made unparalleled bounds largely because the cost of charge-coupled devices (the core of every camera), microprocessors and varied sensors has fallen away as rapidly as computing power and memory have expanded.&quot;

We start with what it means to be an integrated AI system. The AI part seems straightforward: the system should perform some task or tasks that people find to require intelligence. As for integration, we feel that there are two important dimensions to consider. First, the system can integrate the functionality of multiple more specialized components in the performance of the task. In an integrated AI system, these components are things like planners, natural language parsers, learning algorithms, speech recognizers, temporal reasoners, logic engines, and so on. These are AI technologies that do not themselves solve a task, but that provide services necessary to do so. The second, less obvious, dimension to consider is the integration between the AI system and the person or people using it. Most, if not all, fielded AI systems have to interact with people at some time. It is in our interests to make this interaction as natural for the people as possible, both to increase the acceptance of the AI technology and to leverage people&#8217;s skills in the performance of the task. So an integrated system, to us, is one that both integrates multiple capabilities in service of a task and integrates its functions with those of its human users.&quot;

He showed how, given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language. He called this language Lisp, for 'List Processing,' because one of his key ideas was to use a simple data structure called a list for both code and data. It's worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as a model for what programming is tending to become in our own time.&quot;

ENIAC -- monster and marvel --debuted 60 years ago. By Michael Kanellos. CNET News.com. &quot;In February 1946, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly were about to unveil, for the first time, an electronic computer to the world. Their ENIAC, or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, could churn 5,000 addition problems in one second, far faster than any device yet invented. The scientists knew that they had created something that would change history, but they weren't sure how to convey their breakthrough to the public. So they painted numbers on some light bulbs and screwed the resulting 'translucent spheres' into ENIAC's panels. Dynamic, flashy lights would thereafter be associated with the computer in the public mind. That touch of showmanship would later prove fitting for the importance of the ENIAC, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this week at the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Moore School of Electrical of Electrical Engineering. Many historians acknowledge that other computers came earlier -- the Z3 in Germany, England's Colossus, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) at Iowa State. But ENIAC arguably accomplished something more important: It sparked the imagination of scientists and industrialists.&quot;

To achieve this flexibility and generality the IPLs introduced many ideas that have become fundamental for computer science in general, including lists, associations, schemas (frames), dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, associative retrieval, functions as arguments, and generators (streams). The IPL-V Manual (Newell, 1961), exploiting the closed subroutine structure of the language, advocated a programming strategy that years later would be reinvented independently as structured programming--mainly top-down programming that avoided go-to's. LISP, developed by John McCarthy in 1958, which embedded these list-processing ideas in the lambda calculus, improved their syntax and incorporated a 'garbage collector' to recover unused memory, soon became the standard programming language for artificial intelligence (AI).&quot;

The Times Higher Education Supplement (December 24, 2004; subscription req'd.). &quot;Not many years ago, a review of artificial intelligence systems reported that the majority were coded in Lisp, a programming language that is particularly suited to their implementation. Lisp, which was devised in the earliest days of computers, survives in many systems today in various forms despite its clumsy syntax involving the extensive use of nested brackets. Thomas Dean, an AI specialist, is an aficionado of Lisp, and most of the examples in his book [Talking with Computers] are given in Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. That is not to say that he excludes more fashionable languages such as Java, indeed he points out that many programming languages vary only in minor syntactical ways from each other.&quot;

By Jacob West (April 28, 2000). &quot;In a quantum computer, the fundamental unit of information (called a quantum bit or qubit), is not binary but rather more quaternary in nature. This qubit property arises as a direct consequence of its adherence to the laws of quantum mechanics which differ radically from the laws of classical physics. A qubit can exist not only in a state corresponding to the logical state 0 or 1 as in a classical bit, but also in states corresponding to a blend or superposition of these classical states. In other words, a qubit can exist as a zero, a one, or simultaneously as both 0 and 1, with a numerical coefficient representing the probability for each state.&quot;

Carnegie Mellon University. &quot;The most precious resource in a computer system is no longer its processor, memory, disk or network. Rather, it is a resource not subject to Moore's law: User Attention. Today's systems distract a user in many explicit and implicit ways, thereby reducing his effectiveness.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Project Aura will fundamentally rethink system design to address this problem. Aura's goal is to provide each user with an invisible halo of computing and information services that persists regardless of location. Meeting this goal will require effort at every level: from the hardware and network layers, through the operating system and middleware, to the user interface and applications.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Project Aura will design, implement, deploy, and evaluate a large-scale system demonstrating the concept of a 'personal information aura' that spans wearable, handheld, desktop and infrastructure computers.&quot;

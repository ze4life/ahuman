Branches of AI
</H1>

<P>
Q. What are the branches of AI?

<P>
A. Here's a list, but some branches are surely missing, because
   no-one has identified them yet.  Some of these may be regarded as
   concepts or topics rather than full branches.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>logical AI</STRONG></DT>
<DD>What a program knows about the world in general
     the facts of the specific situation in which it must act, and its
     goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical
     logical language.  The program decides what to do by inferring
     that certain actions are appropriate for achieving its goals.
     The first article proposing this was [<A
 HREF="node5.html#McC59">McC59</A>].  [<A
 HREF="node5.html#McC89">McC89</A>]
     is a more recent summary.  [<A
 HREF="node5.html#McC96d">McC96b</A>] lists some of the
     concepts involved in logical aI.  [<A
 HREF="node5.html#Shanahan97">Sha97</A>] is an
     important text.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>search</STRONG></DT>
<DD>AI programs often examine large numbers of
     possibilities, e.g. moves in a chess game or inferences by a
     theorem proving program.  Discoveries are continually made about
     how to do this more efficiently in various domains.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>pattern recognition</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When a program makes observations of
     some kind, it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a
     pattern.  For example, a vision program may try to match a
     pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in order to find a face.
     More complex patterns, e.g. in a natural language text, in a
     chess position, or in the history of some event are also
     studied.  These more complex patterns require quite different
     methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the
     most. 

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>representation</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Facts about the world have to be represented
     in some way.  Usually languages of mathematical logic are used.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>inference</STRONG></DT>
<DD>From some facts, others can be inferred.
     Mathematical logical deduction is adequate for some purposes, but
     new methods of <I>non-monotonic</I> inference have been added to
     logic since the 1970s.  The simplest kind of non-monotonic
     reasoning is default reasoning in which a conclusion is to be
     inferred by default, but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there
     is evidence to the contrary.  For example, when we hear of a
     bird, we man infer that it can fly, but this conclusion can be
     reversed when we hear that it is a penguin.  It is the
     possibility that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that
     constitutes the non-monotonic character of the reasoning.
     Ordinary logical reasoning is monotonic in that the set of
     conclusions that can the drawn from a set of premises is a
     monotonic increasing function of the premises.  Circumscription
     is another form of non-monotonic reasoning.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>common sense knowledge and reasoning</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the area in
     which AI is farthest from human-level, in spite of the fact that
     it has been an active research area since the 1950s.  While there
     has been considerable progress, e.g. in developing systems of
     <I>non-monotonic reasoning</I> and theories of action, yet more
     new ideas are needed.  The Cyc system contains a large but spotty 
     collection of common sense facts.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>learning from experience</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Programs do that.  The approaches
     to AI based on <I>connectionism</I> and <I>neural nets</I> specialize in
     that.  There is also learning of laws expressed in logic.
     [<A
 HREF="node5.html#Mitchell97">Mit97</A>] is a comprehensive undergraduate text on
     machine learning.  Programs can only learn what facts or
     behaviors their formalisms can represent, and unfortunately
     learning systems are almost all based on very limited abilities
     to represent information.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>planning</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Planning programs start with general facts about
     the world (especially facts about the effects of actions), facts
     about the particular situation and a statement of a goal.  From
     these, they generate a strategy for achieving the goal.  In the
     most common cases, the strategy is just a sequence of actions.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>epistemology</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is a study of the kinds of knowledge that
     are required for solving problems in the world.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ontology</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Ontology is the study of the kinds of things that
     exist.  In AI, the programs and sentences deal with various kinds
     of objects, and we study what these kinds are and what their
     basic properties are.  Emphasis on ontology begins in the 1990s.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>heuristics</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A heuristic is a way of trying to discover
     something or an idea imbedded in a program.  The term is used
     variously in AI.  <I>Heuristic functions</I> are used in some
     approaches to search to measure how far a node in a search tree
     seems to be from a goal.  <I>Heuristic predicates</I> that
     compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than
     the other, i.e. constitutes an advance toward the goal, may be
     more useful. [My opinion].

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>genetic programming</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Genetic programming is a technique for
     getting programs to solve a task by mating random Lisp programs
     and selecting fittest in millions of generations.  It is being
     developed by John Koza's group and here's a

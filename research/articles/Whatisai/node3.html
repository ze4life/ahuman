Applications of AI
</H1>

<P>
Q. What are the applications of AI?

<P>
A. Here are some.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>game playing</STRONG></DT>
<DD>You can buy machines that can play master level
  chess for a few hundred dollars.  There is some AI in them, but they
  play well against people mainly through brute force
  computation--looking at hundreds of thousands of positions.  To
  beat a world champion by brute force and known reliable heuristics
  requires being able to look at 200 million positions per second.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>speech recognition</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In the 1990s, computer speech recognition
  reached a practical level for limited purposes.  Thus United
  Airlines has replaced its keyboard tree for flight information by a
  system using speech recognition of flight numbers and city names.
  It is quite convenient.  On the the other hand,  while it is
  possible to instruct some computers using speech, most users have
  gone back to the keyboard and the mouse as still more convenient.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>understanding natural language</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Just getting a sequence of
  words into a computer is not enough.  Parsing sentences is not
  enough either.  The computer has to be provided with an
  understanding of the domain the text is about, and this is presently
  possible only for very limited domains.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>computer vision</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The world is composed of three-dimensional
  objects, but the inputs to the human eye and computers' TV cameras
  are two dimensional.  Some useful programs can work solely in two
  dimensions, but full computer vision
  requires partial three-dimensional
  information that is not just a set of two-dimensional
  views.  At present there are only limited ways of representing
  three-dimensional information directly, and they are not as good as
  what humans evidently use.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>expert systems</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A ``knowledge engineer'' interviews experts in a
  certain domain and tries to embody their knowledge in a computer
  program for carrying out some task.  How well this works depends on
  whether the intellectual mechanisms required for the task are within
  the present state of AI.  When this turned out not to be so, there
  were many disappointing results.  One of the first expert systems
  was MYCIN in 1974, which diagnosed bacterial infections of the blood
  and suggested treatments.  It did better than medical students or
  practicing doctors, provided its limitations were observed.  Namely,
  its ontology included bacteria, symptoms, and treatments and did not
  include patients, doctors, hospitals, death, recovery, and events
  occurring in time.  Its interactions depended on a single patient
  being considered.  Since the experts consulted by the knowledge
  engineers knew about patients, doctors, death, recovery, etc., it is
  clear that the knowledge engineers forced what the experts told them
  into a predetermined framework.  In the present state of AI, this
  has to be true.  The usefulness of current expert systems depends on
  their users having common sense.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>heuristic classification</STRONG></DT>
<DD>One of the most feasible kinds of
  expert system given the present knowledge of AI is to put some
  information in one of a fixed set of categories using several
  sources of information.  An example is advising whether to accept a
  proposed credit card purchase.  Information is available about the
  owner of the credit card, his record of payment and also about the
  item he is buying and about the establishment from which he is
  buying it (e.g., about whether there have been previous credit card
  frauds at this establishment).

<P>
Q. How is AI research done?

<P>
A. AI research has both theoretical and experimental sides.  The
experimental side has both basic and applied aspects.

<P>
There are two main lines of research.  One is biological, based on the
idea that since humans are intelligent, AI should study humans and
imitate their psychology or physiology.  The other is phenomenal,
based on studying and formalizing common sense facts about the world
and the problems that the world presents to the achievement of goals.
The two approaches interact to some extent, and both should eventually
succeed.  It is a race, but both racers seem to be walking.

<P>
Q. What are the relations between AI and philosophy?

<P>
A. AI has many relations with philosophy, especially modern analytic
philosophy.  Both study mind, and both study common sense.  The
best reference is [<A
 HREF="node5.html#Thomason03a">Tho03</A>].

<P>
Q. How are AI and logic programming related?

<P>
A. At the very least, logic programming provides useful programming
languages (mainly Prolog).

<P>
Beyond that, sometimes a theory  useful in AI can be expressed as a
collection  of <I>Horn clauses</I>, and goal  to be achieved can be
expressed as that of finding values of variables 
satisfying an expression <!-- MATH
 $g(x_1\ldots x_n)$
 -->
.  The problem can
sometimes be solved by running the Prolog program consisting of 
and .

<P>
There are two possible obstacles to regarding AI as logic programming.
First, Horn theories do not exhaust first order logic.  Second, the
Prolog program expressing the theory may be extremely inefficient.
More elaborate control than just executing the program that expresses
the theory is often needed.  Map coloring provides examples.

<P>
Q. What should I study before or while learning AI?

<P>
A. Study mathematics, especially mathematical logic.  The more you
learn about sciences, e.g. physics or biology, the better.  For the
biological approaches to AI, study psychology and the physiology of
the nervous system.  Learn some programming languages--at least C,
Lisp and Prolog.  It is also a good idea to learn one basic machine
language.  Jobs are likely to depend on knowing the languages
currently in fashion.  In the late 1990s, these include C++ and Java.

<P>
Q. What is a good textbook on AI?

<P>
A. <I>Artificial Intelligence</I> by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig,
Prentice Hall is the most commonly used textbbook in 1997.  The
general views expressed there do not exactly correspond to those of
this essay.  <I>Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis</I> by Nils
Nilsson, Morgan Kaufman, may be easier to read.  Some people prefer
<I>Computational Intelligence</I> by David Poole, Alan Mackworth and
Randy Goebel, Oxford, 1998.

<P>
Q. What organizations and publications are concerned with AI?

<P>
A. <A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://www.aaai.org">The American Association for Artificial
  Intelligence (AAAI)</A>, the
<A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://www.eccai.org/">European Coordinating Committee for Artificial

Intelligence (ECCAI)</A>
and the
<A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/aisb">Society for Artificial Intelligence and
  Simulation of Behavior (AISB)</A>
are
scientific societies concerned with AI research.  The Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM) has a special interest group on artificial
intelligence
<A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigart">SIGART</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://www.ijcai.org">The International Joint Conference on AI
  (IJCAI)</A>
is the main international conference.
The <A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="http://www.aaai.org">AAAI</A>
runs a US
  National Conference on AI.  <A NAME="tex2html10"
  HREF="http://www.ida.liu.se/ext/etai/"><I>Electronic
      Transactions on Artificial Intelligence</I></A>,

<A NAME="tex2html11"
  HREF="http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/artint/"><I>Artificial Intelligence</I></A>, and

<A NAME="tex2html12"
  HREF="http://www.jair.org/"><I>Journal of Artificial Intelligence
      Research</I></A>, and

<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="http://computer.org/tpami/">IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and
    Machine Intelligence</A>
are four of the
  main journals publishing AI research papers.  I have not yet found
  everything that should be in this paragraph.

<P>
<A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/ppr/"><I>Page of Positive Reviews</I></A>
lists papers that
experts have found important.

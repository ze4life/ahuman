## Biological Neural Networks ##

  * brain consists of **gray matter** and **white matter**
    * gray matter is mostly collection of neurons
    * white matter is mostly collection of myelinated (surrounded by matter like insulation) axons
  * gray matter can be in form of **cortex** or **nucleus**
    * in cortex neurons are layered
    * in nucleus neurons are organized like cashew nuts inside a bowl
  * cortex can be of different types
    * **neocortex**, often called **cerebral cortex**
    * allocortex
    * mesocortex

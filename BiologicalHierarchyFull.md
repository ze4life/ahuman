## Divisions of Nervous System ##

### Classical Divisions ###

Classical **biological divisions** are:
  * anatomically is divided into
    * **central nervous system** (CNS)
      * brain
      * spinal cord
    * **peripheral nervous system** (PNS) - convey neural messages from sense organs and sensory receptors to CNS and from CNS to muscles and glands
      * **cranial nerves** - nerves emerging from brain
      * **spinal nerves** - nerves emerging from spinal cord
  * functionally is divided into
    * **somatic nervous system**
      * conveying and processing **conscious and unconscious sensory** (afferent) information, vision, pain, touch, unconscious muscle sense from head, body wall, and extremities to CNS
      * motor (efferent) control of **voluntary** (striated) muscles
    * **autonomic (visceral) nervous system**
      * conveying and processing sensory input from **visceral** organs
      * motor control of **involuntary** (smooth) and cardiac musculature, and of glands of viscera

### aHuman Divisions ###

For the purpose of modeling, to limit number of top-level items and simplify their names, to prevent from ambiguity related to different biological groupings, **aHuman divisions** are defined:
  * Sensors and effectors
    * HSA (head sensors area)
    * BEA (body effectors area)
  * Mind
    * PCA (posterior cortex area)
    * ACA (anterior cortex area)

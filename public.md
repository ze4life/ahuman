## Theory of Chaos ##

  * chaos is not random, but result of complex set of interactions, that are hard to calculate
  * different sorts of chaos has different level of disorder, most ordered chaos is named **chaotic attractors**

# Memory #

## Episodic Memory ##

  * motor learning requires many times to complete
  * after **episodic learning** we remember complex details very well though experienced only once
  * concatenate temporally-separated, multimodal stimuli and abstract concepts
    * things can be quite abstract
    * things can relate to different modalities
    * embedded in temporal context in which order is preserved
  * there is partial remembering
    * important events undergo **termed consolidation**
    * hippocampus is brain region where recent memories are initially stored
    * more important memories are transferred to cortical areas

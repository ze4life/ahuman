    Depressor naris -lowers and may flare the alar pars of the nose
    Levator labii superioris alaque nasi - wrinkles the nose and is the basis for AU 9 in FACS
    Pyramidalis - lowers the glabella and helps wrinkle the nose

mouth
    Caninus (Levator anguli oris) - elevates the lateral parts of the lips and is the basis for AU 13 in FACS
    Depressor anguli oris (Triangularis) - pulls the corners of the mouth downwards and is the basis of AU 15 in FACS
    Masseter - a powerful muscle of mastication that closes the jaw
    Orbicularis oris - acts to constrict and deform the lips and mouth opening and is the basis for several FACS AUs
    Quadratus (Depressor) labii inferioris - pulls the lower lip down and is the underlying muscle of AU 16
    Quadratus labii superioris - a muscle in the medial cheek and nose are that has multiple strands, including:
	Levator labii superioris or Caput infraobitalis - pulls the upper lip upwards and is the basis of AU 10 in FACS
	Caput zygomatic - more lateral strand often not separately distinguished
    Risorius - retracts the lip corners and is the basis of AU 20 in FACS
    Temporalis - elevates the jaw and moves it forward
    Zygomatic - retracts and pulls the lip corners upwards
	Zygomatic major - retracts and pulls the lip corners upwards and is the basis of AU 12 in FACS
	Zygomatic minor - retracts and pulls the lip corners upwards and is the basis of AU 11 in FACS

neck
    Levator (anguli) scapulae - a muscle in the back of the neck that helps control head position
    Platysma - a large muscle that lies under the jaw and down the neck to the upper chest, and is the basis of AU 21 in FACS
    Scalenus posticus - one of three scaleni, deep neck muscles that help position the head
    Splenius - a muscle at the back of the neck with two parts, helps position the head
    Sternocleidomastoid - a ribbon-like muscle running along the side of the neck that tilts the head right or left
    Trapezius - a large muscle in the area of the back shoulder, that has some fibers in the neck

face
    Buccinator - acts to compress the cheek towards the teeth and is the underlying muscle of AU 14 in FACS
    Corrugator - lowers and pulls the eyebrows together and is the basis of AU 4 in FACS
    Epicranius - runs over the top of the skull from the eyebrows to the back of the skull and has the following two parts:
    	Frontalis - pulls the eyebrows up and is the basis of AUs 1 and 2 in FACS, and
	Occipitalis - tightens back of the scalp
    Fascia parotideomasseterica - covering the masseter muscleand parotid gland is a sheet of fascia tissue
    Galea aponeurotica - tough tissue on the top of the skull
    Transversus menti (Mentalis) - pushes chin up and wrinkles chin boss and is basis of FACS AU 17

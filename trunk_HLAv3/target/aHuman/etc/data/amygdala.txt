Connections:
	association between current sensory inputs and past experience
	emotional responses - activation of autonomic and hormonal systems
	lesion - absence of anger and fear, increased exploration, visual agnosia, hyperorality, hypersexualtity, and loss of social interactions
	largely modulates plasticity in other brain regions that are substrates for memory storage
	plasticity within amygdala is associated with fear conditioning

# Introduction #

This section is created to find a system in waves of words and concepts of various origins.
This Wiki area is not about aHuman project itself, but should assist to find already existing solution without long-term Web-searching activity. Dictionary will easily show what you already know, and what exists around your point of interest, especially including last-year development.

Dictionary items are structured by usage pattern (links below) and on any given page - grouped by subsection depending on page, and then 2-level lists where leaf-level item is subtype of first-level item.
Any sub-sub-items should placed near the same.

Most dictionary items don't have any explanations.
It is expected that you are able to search Wikipedia or google for them.
Still if you feel that something is quite essential - add dictionary item page and fill in any description (please follow Wikipedia approach to create fair information).

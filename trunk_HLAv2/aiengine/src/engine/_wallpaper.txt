FEATURES
----------------------------------------------
service management
	- services startup/shutdown

configuration management
	- access to configuration
	- named configuration cache

thread management
	- thread counting, waiting for completion
	- add/get per-thread objects, auto deleted

logging
	- console/file logging
	- log levels
	- sync/async logging
	- auto add timing up to ms, thread info
	- multi-line log records
	- per-class logging settings based on service name or object class
	- persist logger settings

persistence
	- forward and backward field set compatibility
	- compound objects
	- embedded lists of datatypes and objects
	- persistance using ids or names
	- serialization of runtime child class in class hierarchy
	- object construction from serialized object
	- serialized objects caching
	- human readable and manually updatable format

exception handling
	- SEH to C++ Exception translation
	- call stack logging
	- C++ and SEH support
	- auto skip system levels
	- class/function reporting
	- locating function where exception raised in SEH
	- single class owning all the information
	- macro to auto gather file/line of raising code location

random generator
	- int/discrete and float/continous random numbers
	- generate numbers in given range
	- collect and print statistics
	- generate numbers in given two ranges

timer
	- time up to milliseconds

string
	- auto-changing
	- common operators to make strings with variable values

low-level file i/o
	- read line from file

math helpers
	- multiindex iterator
	- min/max of 2 values, min/max of any product of 4 values
	- comparing floats with tolerance

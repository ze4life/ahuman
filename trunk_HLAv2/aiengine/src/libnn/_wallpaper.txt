LIVE FEATURES
----------------------------------------------
A-service
	- reads in async all incoming messages
	- parses message to tokens

B-finder-factory
	- creates finder
	- using sample storage with statistics
	- automatically extends statistics attributes without loss of data

C-finder
	- create perceptron for generic classification/boolean functions
	- estimate class & probability by targets
	- helper statistics to verify NN methods
	- restartable to ensure 100% probability

D-neural-network
	- persistable
	- auto scaling based on sensor and target ranges
	- per-neuron induction/activation functions and connections, activation steepness
	- settable validation function
	- live modifications: add sensors

E-training-data
	- persistable
	- scale using simple min/max, stddev

	- init weights using Widrow + Nguyen's algorithm
	- learning smooth/momentum
	- settable error/stop functions
	- train by different algorithms: incremental/batch/iRPROP/QuickProp

G-scan-strategy
	- optimize by limited subset of axes (3 by default)
	- select best axes in subset
	- several layers of search, by precision and area
	- leave only 10 points in search for each layer
	- add only points tha are minimums across given subset of axes (subset minimum)
	- select next layer scan for minimums across all axes (absolute minimum)
	- show 2-axes slices of scan area

H-training-debug-helper
	- show perceptron/samples
	- show changes for back propagation
	- show error surface using 2D slices
	- show clustering results

This page is reduction of [BiologicalHierarchyFull Full Biological Hierarchy] for the purpose of modeling in aHuman.

== Biological Reduction Rationale ==

  * reduction hierarchy contains only functions copied to aHuman
  * visual brain functions are regarded as generic sensory approach
  * motor is replaced by effector, movement is action
  * body remained as term, but its nature is completely different for aHuman
   * task performed for the mind is the same - default reward system and mandatory part for any action
   * hence somatosensory brain elements remained predefined mandatory sensor, body feeling.
  * single hemisphere is assumed to be enough
  * blood and heart are regarded as regulatory functions, controlling resources spent by brain
  * thalamic area is primarily considered as relay, and to simplify picture, some direct ways, e.g. ACA to HCA are treated as passing via THA
  * limbic lobe was split into parts allocated to other modules, because parts of limbic system seem to me quite different while having strong connections to specific parts
   * anterior cingulate cortex has strong bidirectional connections with anterior cortex and allocated to ACA, posterior cingulate - to PCA as well
   * secondary role of thalamic area is spreading of modulatory activity (sleep-awake cycle, hormones, neurotransmitters and others), and because of that septal nuclei allocated to THA 
   * hippocampus is strong aligned with memory formation functions of temporal lobe - enthorinal and perirhinal cortices and eventually allocated to HCA
   * fornix is hippocampus communication facility and that's why allocated also to HCA
   * basal ganglia is rational primitive motor system and needs to be separate module because it is one of major non-cortical functions
   * amygdala is allocated to BGA because generating movements by emotional, but not rational signals

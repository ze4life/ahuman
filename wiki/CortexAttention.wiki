== Attention in the Neocortex ==

see 2007 - Model of covert attention and learning

==== Overview of the cortex ====

  * cerebral cortex is neocortex and old structures like hippocampus
  * most intelligent animals have larger absolute and relative neocortex
  * neocortex is responsible for things such as processing sensory information, learning associations, consciousness and working memory (compare to Jeff Hawkins - neocortex is responsible for prediction)
  * after evolution it receives input from all sources and thus can build world model
  * independently of the location on the cortex, it has the same six-layered columnar structure and the same micro-connectivity

==== Learning Feature Representations ====

  * exceptional feature of the motor cortex is that it has power to control the muscles
  * higher levels represent longer lasting actions that are more abstract and consist of many primitive actions
  * when motor cortex attends to some actions, the muscles actually perform those actions
  * when an animal attends to some features in its sensations, the neural representations even in the lowest cortical levels adapt mostly to those features and not to others
  * feedback connections could also help in relating the neural representations to their context and thus give meaning to the raw bottom-up data
   * if the context does not change when the inputs change, the context could teach the neuron that the different inputs are actually instantiations of the same object
   * feedback connections could act as teaching signals for the neurons

==== Attention in Neocortex ====

  * sensory cortex cannot represent all objects existing in the inputs at the same time - there is selective attention
  * neocortex can think about and perceive only few different things simultaneously (covert attention)
  * possible reasons of attention limitation:
   * *neuron has much synaptic information but little activity information* - active state cannot represent all the knowledge of the neuron simultaneously
   * *binding problem* - one simple feature can take part in representing many different things; when two population codes overlap, the features between the objects can get mixed up; the right combinations of features can be found if only few objects are attended at once; the simulated reality must be kept apart from the real world, and different future plans must be kept from interfering with each other
   * invariant reference frame for pattern recognition - the same objects can appear in many different forms (weak)
  * targets of attention are selected based on bottom-up saliency and high-level intentions
  * *saliency* can be:
   * high contrast
   * good continuity
   * unexpectedness - in spatial or temporal context; dangerous or new opportunity
   * attending to salient targets can be reasonable for alive being - improves probability of having real object
  * high-level *intentions* can be:
   * search for certain objects from the visual field
   * can be controlled to target any kind of features, like spatial locations or auditory frequency bands
   * top-down control signals are thought to originate in the *frontal cortex*
  * *biased-competition model of attention* - all attention emerges from local competition between different features in the neural hierarchies; this competition can be biased with top-down signal, allowing for search of certain features
   * competition between different spatial locations works similarly to that between different features
   * if a certain object is given attentional bias, then the location of that object is searched for
   * if the bias is given to some location, then the cortex will recognise the possible object in that location

==== Architecture of Neocortex ====
  
  * *connections*
   * 1st-order: thalamic -> inputs (layer 4) -> contextual (layers 1-3) -> outputs (layers 5-6) -> higher-order thalamic
   * higher-order: thalamic -> inputs -> contextual -> outputs -> ...
  * *minicolumns* form larger *columns* and *hypercolumns*
  * all neurons within one minicolumn respond roughly to similar stimuli
  * *suggestions*:
   * some layers could represent the true state of the world 
   * other layers could represent unexpected novelties
   * some layers could form laterally coherent feature aggregates between neighbouring columns
  * crucial connection type is *feedback connections*
   * more numerous than the bottom-up connections
   * cannot cause activations in the target neurons, but only modulate the activations
   * originate from the near surroundings of that area
   * important set of connections is feedback from the next hierarchical level
  * great amount of contextual input into layer 1 comes from special context mediating *matrix cells* in the thalamus

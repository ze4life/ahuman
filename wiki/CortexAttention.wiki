== Attention in the Neocortex ==

see 2007 - Model of covert attention and learning

  * sensory cortex cannot represent all objects existing in the inputs at the same time - there is selective attention
  * neocortex can think about and perceive only few different things simultaneously (covert attention)
  * possible reasons of attention limitation:
   * *neuron has much synaptic information but little activity information* - active state cannot represent all the knowledge of the neuron simultaneously
   * *binding problem* - one simple feature can take part in representing many different things; when two population codes overlap, the features between the objects can get mixed up; the right combinations of features can be found if only few objects are attended at once; the simulated reality must be kept apart from the real world, and different future plans must be kept from interfering with each other
   * invariant reference frame for pattern recognition - the same objects can appear in many different forms (weak)
  * targets of attention are selected based on bottom-up saliency and high-level intentions
  * *saliency* can be:
   * high contrast
   * good continuity
   * unexpectedness - in spatial or temporal context; dangerous or new opportunity
   * attending to salient targets can be reasonable for alive being - improves probability of having real object
  * high-level *intentions* can be:
   * search for certain objects from the visual field
   * can be controlled to target any kind of features, like spatial locations or auditory frequency bands
   * top-down control signals are thought to originate in the *frontal cortex*
  * *biased-competition model of attention* - all attention emerges from local competition between different features in the neural hierarchies; this competition can be biased with top-down signal, allowing for search of certain features
   * competition between different spatial locations works similarly to that between different features
   * if a certain object is given attentional bias, then the location of that object is searched for
   * if the bias is given to some location, then the cortex will recognise the possible object in that location

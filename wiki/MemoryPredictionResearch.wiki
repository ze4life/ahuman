Memory Prediction research covers using HTM/Memory Prediction theory for memorizing and recognizing complex patterns, produce internal representation.

== Terms ==

== Research targets ==

  * Analyze results of research by Numenta 
  * Adopt Open Source libraries
  * Understand limits of technology
  * Map technology to the tasks of AI from aHuman perspective
  * Produce internal representation of perceived sensor data - [InternalRepresentationResearch]

== Useful resources ==

  * http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=3702

== Numbers == 

  * HI neocortex has between 2-5 million neocortical columns  
  * HI neocortical column has ~50,000 neurons
  * HI has 25 connections per neuron in average
  * HI operates at around 10^15 computations per seconds
  * human DNA has 20,000-25,000 genes
  * Neural density is 100,000 n/mm3

== Useful things ==

  * simple features such as color, brightness, motion and form - see [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070314134812.htm amex]

== Open Source Libraries currently under investigation ==

Memory Prediction research covers using HTM/Memory Prediction theory for memorizing and recognizing complex patterns, produce internal representation.

== Terms ==

== Research targets ==

  * [OnIntelligenceReview Insights from book by Jeff Hawkins - On Intelligence]
  * [VisionResearch Research on aHuman Vision]
  * [NumentaResearch Analyze results of research by Numenta]
  * Adopt Open Source libraries
  * Map technology to the tasks of AI from aHuman perspective
  * Produce internal representation of perceived sensor data - [InternalRepresentationResearch]

== Numbers == 

  * HI neocortex has 10 times more feedback connections than feed forward ones
  * one neuron has max speed of 10ms
  * HI can recognise picture in 1 second hence having no more than 100-hop sequences
  * HI neocortex has exactly 6 layers
  * HI neocortex is 2mm thick and covers both hemispheres of human's head
  * HI neocortex has between 2-5 million neocortical columns  
  * HI neocortical column has ~50,000 neurons
  * HI has 25 connections per neuron in average
  * HI operates at around 10^15 computations per seconds
  * human DNA has 20,000-25,000 genes
  * Neural density is 100,000 n/mm3

== Thoughts ==

  * consider sequence - word "concatenation"
   * sequences are based on emotional stressing - con-cate-nation
   * consider you start hearing "ncate"
   * you will ignore "n" as it could be part of "in category"
   * you will surely map "cate" to strong subsequence
   * so your expected word will be "cate-gory"
   * you will recognise "(con)-cate-nation" - after hearing "nation" - like you go to wrong direction then confused and returned to the forked way

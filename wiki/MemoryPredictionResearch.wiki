Memory Prediction research covers using HTM/Memory Prediction theory for memorizing and recognizing complex patterns, produce internal representation.

== Terms ==

  * *cerebral cortex* = neocortex + some old brain structures, e.g. hippocampus and olfactory cortex
  * *covert attention* - neocortex can both think about and perceive only a few different things simultaneously
  * *overt attention* - physically orienting toward some targets

== Research targets ==

  * [OnIntelligenceReview] - Insights from book by Jeff Hawkins - On Intelligence
  * [NumentaResearch] - Analyze results of research by Numenta
  * [VisionResearch] - Research on aHuman Vision
  * [CortexRequirements] - Requirements for Cortex element to use in neocortex area
  * [InternalRepresentationResearch] - Produce internal representation of perceived sensor data
  * [MemoryFormation] - Memory formation in humans
  * Adopt Open Source libraries

== Numbers == 

  * HI neocortex has 10 times more feedback connections than feed forward ones
  * one neuron has max speed of 10ms
  * HI can recognise picture in 1 second hence having no more than 100-hop sequences
  * HI neocortex has exactly 6 layers
  * HI neocortex is 2mm thick and covers both hemispheres of human's head
  * HI neocortex area is 0.2 m2
  * HI neocortex has 2-5 million neocortical columns  
  * HI neocortex has 300-500M micro-columns
  * HI neocortical column has ~50,000 neurons
  * HI has 25 connections per neuron in average
  * HI operates at around 10^15 computations per seconds
  * neural density is 100,000 n/mm3
  * optical nerve has 1M axons
  * auditory nerve has 30K axons
  * human DNA has 20,000-25,000 genes
  * between regions, in myelin insolation, signal is spreading via axon with 200 miles/hour = 9 cm/ms

== Human Cortex Features ==

  * unsupervised learning of abstraction hierarchies for representing the structure in the world
  * learning invariant representations
  * covers both sensors and effectors
  * uses the same algorithm with local adjustments
  * learns - to predict the future, filter unnecessary information away, generalise
  * forms associations
  * cat can live without cortex, human cannot - cortex has too much responsibility for muscles
  * cortex implements selective attention
  * cortex has long-term (episodic) memory along hippocampus
  * cortex learns about rewarding features, on par with basal ganglia
  * teaching signals are contextual inputs from the thalamus matrix cells and the neuromodulators
  * extra plasticity in critical period
  * global neuromodulation signals mediate information about rewards and punishments

== Thoughts ==

  * consider sequence - word "concatenation"
   * sequences are based on emotional stressing - con-cate-nation
   * consider you start hearing "ncate"
   * you will ignore "n" as it could be part of "in category"
   * you will surely map "cate" to strong subsequence
   * so your expected word will be "cate-gory"
   * you will recognise "(con)-cate-nation" - after hearing "nation" - like you go to wrong direction then confused and returned to the forked way
  * consider similarity between invariant representation in neocortex and error function as content of feed-forward flow
   * invariant representation of auditory information - relative intervals, not absolute notes are stored and recognized

== 2010 Jeff Hawkins ideas ==

see [http://www.numenta.com/htm-overview/education/jeff-2010-smithgroup-lecture.php Link]

  * Biology data - 5 layers (plus 1 connectivity)
   * cells in columns have similar response properties
   * majority of connections are within layer
   * feed-forward connections are few but strong
   * layers 4 and 3 are primary feed-forward layers, layer 4 disappears if ascend hierarchy
  * Hypothesis
   * common mechanism in each layer
   * each layer is a sequence memory - learns transitions of sparse distributed patterns
   * layer 4 learns first order transitions - spatial inference, simple cells
   * layer 3 learns variable order transitions - time-based inference, complex cells
   * layer 5 motor
   * layers 2,6 - feedback, attention
  * Real neuron
   * proximity dendrites - linear summation, feed-forward, Nx100 synapses
   * distal dendrites - dozens of regions, non-linear integration, lateral connections, Nx1K synapses
   * ongoing forming and unforming of synapses
   * variable spike rate

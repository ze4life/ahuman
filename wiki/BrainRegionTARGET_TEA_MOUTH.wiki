*Component items*:
  * *Submandibular Gland (mouth-submandibular-gland)*: produces 70% of saliva in oral cavity, mixed serous (moisturing) and mucous (process food)
  * *Sublingual Gland (mouth-sublingual-gland)*: produces 5% of saliva in oral cavity, mostly mucous
  * *Parotid Gland (mouth-parotid-gland)*: produces 25% of saliva in oral cavity, mostly serous
  * *Oral Mucosa (mouth-oral-mucosal-gland)*: lubrication, immunological defence
  * *Tongue Gustatory Hair Cell (mouth-tongue-hair-cell)*: taste sensation
  * *Epiglottis (mouth-epiglottis-taste-buds)*: taste sensation
  * *Tongue Muscles (mouth-tongue-muscles)*: move tongue
  * *Lips Muscles (mouth-lips-muscles)*: move lips
  * *Genioglossus Muscle (mouth-genioglossus-muscle)*: keeps airway open and enables tongue to stick out and retract
  * *Hyoglossus Muscle (mouth-hyoglossus-muscle)*: depress and retract the tongue, important in singing
  * *Styloglossus Muscle (mouth-styloglossus-muscle)*: chewing, talking, suckling, and many other functions of tongue
  * *Palatine Tonsil (mouth-palatine-tonsil)*: providing antibodies against illnesses and diseases such as diphtheria
  * *Lingual Tonsil (mouth-lingual-tonsil)*: production of antibodies that are part of natural immune system
  * *Uvula (mouth-uvula)*: preventing food from entering the nasal cavity
  * *Teeth (mouth-teeth)*: chewing
  * *Phonatory Muscles (mouth-larynx-phonatory-muscles)*: move vocal cords together and serve production of voice
  * *Respiratory Muscles (mouth-larynx-respiratory-muscles)*: move vocal cords apart and serve breathing
  * *Posterior Belly of Digastric Muscles (mouth-posterior-digastric-muscles)*: elevate hyoid bone to open mouth
  * *Posterior Belly of Digastric Muscles (mouth-stylohyoid-muscles)*: draw hyoid bone backwards and elevate tongue

*Component items*:
  * *Mouth - parotid gland (mouth-parotid-gland)*: produces 25% of saliva in oral cavity, mostly serous
  * *Mouth - submandibular gland (mouth-submandibular-gland)*: produces 70% of saliva in oral cavity, mixed serous (moisturing) and mucous (process food)
  * *Mouth - sublingual gland (mouth-sublingual-gland)*: produces 5% of saliva in oral cavity, mostly mucous
  * *Mouth - parotid gland vasoconstrictors (mouth-parotid-gland-vasoconstrictors)*: reduces glandular bloodflow
  * *Mouth - submandibular gland vasoconstrictors (mouth-submandibular-gland-vasoconstrictors)*: reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume of fluid in salivary secretions
  * *Mouth - sublingual gland vasoconstrictors (mouth-sublingual-gland-vasoconstrictors)*: reduces glandular bloodflow
  * *Mouth - hard palate mucous gland (mouth-hard-palate-mucosal-gland)*: produce mucous fluid; lubrication, immunological defence
  * *Mouth - soft palate mucous gland (mouth-soft-palate-mucosal-gland)*: produce mucous fluid; lubrication, immunological defence
  * *Mouth - tongue gustatory hair cell (mouth-tongue-hair-cell)*: taste sensation

  * *Mouth - palatine tonsil (mouth-palatine-tonsil)*: providing antibodies against illnesses and diseases such as diphtheria
  * *Mouth - lingual tonsil (mouth-lingual-tonsil)*: production of antibodies that are part of natural immune system
  * *Mouth - uvula receptors (mouth-uvula-receptors)*: preventing food from entering the nasal cavity
  * *Mouth - musculus uvulae muscle (mouth-uvulae-muscle)*: elevates and retracts the uvula, thickening the central part of the soft palate; shortens and broadens the uvula
  * *Mouth - teeth (mouth-teeth)*: chewing
  * *Mouth tongue muscles (mouth-tongue-muscles)*
   * *Mouth - genioglossus muscle (mouth-genioglossus-muscle)*: keeps airway open and enables tongue to stick out and retract
   * *Mouth - hyoglossus muscle (mouth-hyoglossus-muscle)*: depress and retract the tongue, important in singing
   * *Mouth - styloglossus muscle (mouth-styloglossus-muscle)*: chewing, talking, suckling, and many other functions of tongue
   * *Mouth - chondroglossus muscle (chondroglossus-muscle)*: depresses tongue
   * *Mouth - palatoglossus muscle (palatoglossus-muscle)*: raising the back part of the tongue

   * *Mouth - inferior longitudinal muscle of tongue (tongue-inferior-longitudinal-muscle)*: shortens, retracts, pulls tip downward
   * *Mouth - stylohyoid muscle (mouth-stylohyoid-muscle)*: draw hyoid bone backwards and elevate tongue; elevate the hyoid during swallowing
  * *Mouth phonatory larynx muscles (mouth-larynx-phonatory-muscles)*: move vocal cords together and serve production of voice
   * *Mouth - lateral cricoarytenoid muscle (lateral-cricoarytenoid-muscle)*: adduct and medially rotate the cartilage, pulling the vocal ligaments towards the midline and backwards and so closing off the rima glottidis

   * *Mouth - posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (posterior-cricoarytenoid-muscle)*: abducts and laterally rotates the cartilage, pulling the vocal ligaments away from the midline and forward and so opening the rima glottidis
   * *Mouth - thyroepiglottic muscle (thyroepiglottic-muscle)*: closes the inlet to the larynx
   * *Mouth - aryepiglottic muscle (aryepiglottic-muscle)*: close the inlet
  * *Mouth - swallowing muscles (swallowing-muscles)*
   * *Mouth - digastric muscle, facial (digastric-muscle-facial)*: opens the jaw when the masseter and the temporalis are relaxed
   * *Mouth - digastric muscle, trigeminal (digastric-muscle-trigeminal)*: opens the jaw when the masseter and the temporalis are relaxed
   * *Mouth - geniohyoid muscle (geniohyoid-muscle)*: carry hyoid bone and the tongue upward during deglutition
   * *Mouth - mylohyoid muscle (mylohyoid-muscle)*: raises oral cavity floor, elevates hyoid, depresses mandible
   * *Mouth - inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle (inferior-pharyngeal-constrictor-muscle)*: swallowing
   * *Mouth - middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle (middle-pharyngeal-constrictor-muscle)*: swallowing
   * *Mouth - superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle (superior-pharyngeal-constrictor-muscle)*: swallowing
  * *Mouth - respiratory larynx muscles (mouth-larynx-respiratory-muscles)*: move vocal cords apart and serve breathing
  * *Mouth - thyrohyoid muscle (mouth-larynx-thyrohyoid-muscle)*: depresses the hyoid and elevates the larynx
  * *Mouth - palatine tonsil receptors (palatine-tonsil-receptors)*: visceral mucous membrane over soft palate and tonsil
  * *Mouth - masseter muscle (masticatory-masseter-muscle)*: elevation (as in closing of the mouth) and retraction of mandible
  * *Mouth - lateral pterygoid muscle (masticatory-lateral-pterygoid-muscle)*: depresses mandible
  * *Mouth - medial pterygoid muscle (masticatory-medial-pterygoid-muscle)*: elevates mandible, closes jaw, helps lateral pterygoids in moving the jaw from side to side
  * *Mouth - temporal muscle (masticatory-temporal-muscle)*: elevation and retraction of mandible
  * *Mouth - proprioception receptors of masticatory muscles (masticatory-unconscious-muscle-spindles)*: unconscious proprioception from muscle spindles; monosynaptic masticatory reflex
  * *Mouth - levator muscle of thyroid gland (thyroid-gland-levator-muscle)*: elevates the thyroid gland
  * *Mouth - levator veli palatini muscle (levator-veli-palatini-muscle)*: elevates soft palate

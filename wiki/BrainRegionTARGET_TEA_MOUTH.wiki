*Component items*:
  * *Submandibular Gland (mouth-submandibular-gland)*: produces 70% of saliva in oral cavity, mixed serous (moisturing) and mucous (process food)
  * *Sublingual Gland (mouth-sublingual-gland)*: produces 5% of saliva in oral cavity, mostly mucous
  * *Submandibular Gland Vasoconstrictors (mouth-submandibular-gland-vasoconstrictors)*: reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume of fluid in salivary secretions
  * *Sublingual Gland Vasoconstrictors (mouth-sublingual-gland-vasoconstrictors)*: reduces glandular bloodflow
  * *Parotid Gland (mouth-parotid-gland)*: produces 25% of saliva in oral cavity, mostly serous
  * *Oral Mucosa (mouth-oral-mucosal-gland)*: lubrication, immunological defence
  * *Tongue Gustatory Hair Cell (mouth-tongue-hair-cell)*: taste sensation
  * *Epiglottis (mouth-epiglottis-taste-buds)*: taste sensation
  * *Tongue Muscles (mouth-tongue-muscles)*: move tongue
  * *Lips Muscles (mouth-lips-muscles)*: move lips
  * *Genioglossus Muscle (mouth-genioglossus-muscle)*: keeps airway open and enables tongue to stick out and retract
  * *Hyoglossus Muscle (mouth-hyoglossus-muscle)*: depress and retract the tongue, important in singing
  * *Styloglossus Muscle (mouth-styloglossus-muscle)*: chewing, talking, suckling, and many other functions of tongue
  * *Palatine Tonsil (mouth-palatine-tonsil)*: providing antibodies against illnesses and diseases such as diphtheria
  * *Lingual Tonsil (mouth-lingual-tonsil)*: production of antibodies that are part of natural immune system
  * *Uvula receptors (mouth-uvula-receptors)*: preventing food from entering the nasal cavity
  * *Teeth (mouth-teeth)*: chewing
  * *Phonatory Muscles (mouth-larynx-phonatory-muscles)*: move vocal cords together and serve production of voice
  * *Respiratory Muscles (mouth-larynx-respiratory-muscles)*: move vocal cords apart and serve breathing
  * *Thyrohyoid Muscle (mouth-larynx-thyrohyoid-muscle)*: depresses the hyoid and elevates the larynx
  * *Posterior Belly of Digastric Muscles (mouth-posterior-digastric-muscles)*: elevate hyoid bone to open mouth
  * *Posterior Belly of Digastric Muscles (mouth-stylohyoid-muscles)*: draw hyoid bone backwards and elevate tongue
  * *Uvula muscle (mouth-uvula-muscle)*: shortens and broadens the uvula
  * *Hard palate mucous gland (hard-palate-mucous-gland)*: produce mucous fluid
  * *Soft palate mucous gland (soft-palate-mucous-gland)*: produce mucous fluid
  * *Soft palate sparse taste receptors (soft-palate-sparse-taste-receptors)*: taste sensation
  * *Soft palate sparse taste receptors (palatine-tonsil-receptors)*: visceral mucous membrane over soft palate and tonsil
  * *Masseter muscle (masticatory-masseter-muscle)*: elevation (as in closing of the mouth) and retraction of mandible
  * *Lateral pterygoid muscle (masticatory-lateral-pterygoid-muscle)*: depresses mandible
  * *Medial pterygoid muscle (masticatory-medial-pterygoid-muscle)*: elevates mandible, closes jaw, helps lateral pterygoids in moving the jaw from side to side
  * *Tensor tympani muscle (masticatory-tensor-tympani-muscle)*: tensing the tympanic membrane
  * *Tensor veli palatini muscle (masticatory-tensor-veli-palatini-muscle)*: tension of the soft palate
  * *Temporal muscle (masticatory-temporal-muscle)*: elevation and retraction of mandible
  * *Proprioception receptors of masticatory muscles (masticatory-unconscious-muscle-spindles)*: unconscious proprioception from muscle spindles; monosynaptic masticatory reflex
  * *Thyroid gland (thyroid-gland)*: release thyroid hormones into blood
  * *Arytenoid muscle (arytenoid-muscle)*: approximate the arytenoid cartilages (close rima glottidis)
  * *Cricothyroid muscle (cricothyroid-muscle)*: tension and elongation of the vocal folds (has minor adductory effect)
  * *Inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle (inferior-pharyngeal-constrictor-muscle)*: swallowing
  * *Levator muscle of thyroid gland (thyroid-gland-levator-muscle)*: elevates the thyroid gland
  * *Lateral cricoarytenoid muscle (lateral-cricoarytenoid-muscle)*: adduct and medially rotate the cartilage, pulling the vocal ligaments towards the midline and backwards and so closing off the rima glottidis
  * *Oblique arytenoid muscle (oblique-arytenoid-muscle)*: sphincter of the laryngeal inlet
  * *Posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (posterior-cricoarytenoid-muscle)*: abducts and laterally rotates the cartilage, pulling the vocal ligaments away from the midline and forward and so opening the rima glottidis
  * *Thyroarytenoid muscle (thyroarytenoid-muscle)*: thickens the vocal folds and decreases length; also helps to adduct the vocal folds during speech
  * *Thyroepiglottic muscle (thyroepiglottic-muscle)*: closes the inlet to the larynx
  * *Occipitalis muscle (occipitalis-muscle)*: moves the scalp back

This page covers biological details of component Postsubiculum.
Region is part of aHuman target integrated biological model.

  * *Top-down path to region*: Forebrain Telencephalon -> Hippocampal Formation (HBA.FT.HF) -> Subicular Complex (HBA.FT.SC) -> Postsubiculum (HBA.FT.SC.PSS) (see [OverallMindMaps Mind Maps])
  * *Brain area*: [BrainAreaHBA Hippocampus Basal Area]
  * *Function*: Integrate visual landmarks with internal representations of environments
  * *Notes to function*: As measured by hippocampal place cells, fear conditioning

= Divisions =

Cerebellum consists of:
  * *Fastigial Nucleus*
  * *Globose Nucleus*
  * *Emboliform Nucleus*
  * *Dentate Nucleus*
  * *Cerebellum Cortex*
  * Interposed Nucleus = Globose Nucleus + Emboliform Nucleus

= Cerebellum Cortex =

Cerebellum Cortex consists of:
  * Medial=Vermal (projects to Fastigial Nucleus)
  * Intermediate=Paravermal (projects to Interposed Nucleus)
  * Lateral=Hemisphere (projects to Dentate Nucleus)

Cerebellum Lobes:
  * Archicerebellum=Vestibulocerebellum (vermis) - vestibular->body
  * Paleocerebellum=Spinocerebellum (vermal, paravermal) - body->body
  * Neocerebellum (posterior) - cortex->body

Cortex Layers:
  * Molecular layer (outer)
  * Purkinje cell layer
  * Granular layer

Neurons:
  * granular cells (total 100G) - like "T"
   * 4-6 short dendrites
   * axon goes to molecular layer and bifurcates into 2 branches
   * branches go in opposite directions
   * branches have excitatory synapses with Purkinje cells dendrites
  * Purkinje cell - the only output of CR
   * each Purkinje cell receives synapses from thousands of parallel fibers
   * Purkinje cell projects to CR nuclei as inhibitory
   * recurrent axon collaterals have inhibitory connections with other Purkinje cells
  * cerebellum nuclei exert excitary influences on muscles

== LUMBAR NERVES ==

  * *cutaneous nerve, perforating* one of the inferior cluneal nerves which pierces the sacrotuberous ligament and supplies the skin over the inferomedial gluteus maximus; it is absent in one third of the population}
   * *cutaneous nerve of thigh, lateral*; ORIGIN={lumbar PLEXUS L2-L3}; DISTRIBUTION={skin of lateral and frontal aspects of thigh}; MODALITY={general sensory}
  * *femoral nerve*; ORIGIN={lumbar PLEXUS (L2-L4); descending behind the inguinal ligament to the femoral triangle}; BRANCHES={saphenous nerve, muscular and anterior cutaneous branches}; DISTRIBUTION={skin of thigh and leg, muscles of front of thigh, and hip and knee joints}; MODALITY={general sensory and motor}
   * *saphenous nerve*; ORIGIN={termination of femoral nerve, descending first with femoral vessels and then on medial side of leg and foot}; BRANCHES={infrapatellar and medial crural cutaneous branches}; DISTRIBUTION={knee joint, subsartorial and patellar plexuses, skin on medial side of leg and foot}; MODALITY={general sensory}
  * *genitofemoral nerve*; ORIGIN={lumbar PLEXUS (L1-L2)}; BRANCHES={genital and femoral branches}; DISTRIBUTION={cremaster muscle, skin of scrotum or labium majus and of adjacent area of thigh and femoral triangle}; MODALITY={general sensory and motor}
  * *iliohypogastric nerve*; ORIGIN={lumbar PLEXUS L1 (sometimes T12)}; BRANCHES={lateral and anterior cutaneous branches}; DISTRIBUTION={the skin above the pubis and over the lateral side of the buttock, and occasionally the pyramidal muscle}; MODALITY={motor and general sensory}
  * *ilioinguinal nerve*; ORIGIN={lumbar PLEXUS L1 (sometimes T12); accompanies the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal}; BRANCHES={anterior scrotal or labial branches}; DISTRIBUTION={skin of scrotum or labia majora, and adjacent part of thigh}; MODALITY={general sensory}
   * *labial nerves, anterior*; ORIGIN={ilioinguinal nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={skin of anterior labial region of labia majora, and adjacent part of thigh}; MODALITY={general sensory}
   * *scrotal nerves, anterior*; ORIGIN={ilioinguinal nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={skin of anterior scrotal region}; MODALITY={general sensory}
  * *lumbar nerves* (furcal nerve - forth lumbar nerve) the five pairs of nerves (L1-L5) that arise from the lumbar segments of the spinal cord, each pair leaving the VERTEBRAL COLUMN below the correspondingly numbered vertebra. The ventral branches of these nerves participate in the formation of the lumbosacral plexus}
   * *cluneal nerves, superior* general sensory nerve branches of (ORIGIN) the dorsal branches of the upper lumbar nerves, innervating the skin of the upper part of the buttocks}
   * *splanchnic nerves, lumbar*; ORIGIN={lumbar GANGLIA or sympathetic trunk}; DISTRIBUTION={upper nerves join celiac and adjacent plexuses, middle ones go to intermesenteric and adjacent plexuses, and lower ones descend to superior hypogastric plexus}; MODALITY={preganglionic sympathetic and visceral afferent}
  * *nerve of quadrate muscle of thigh*; ORIGIN={ventral branches of ventral branches of lumbar PLEXUS L4-L5}; DISTRIBUTION={inferior gemellus muscle, anterior quadratus muscle of thigh, hip joint}; MODALITY={general sensory and motor}
  * *obturator nerve*
   * *obturator nerve*; ORIGIN={lumbar PLEXUS L3-L4}; BRANCHES={anterior, posterior, and muscular branches}; DISTRIBUTION={adductor muscles and gracilis muscle, skin of medial part of thigh, and hip and knee joints}; MODALITY={general sensory and motor}
   * *obturator nerve, accessory*; ORIGIN={ventral branches of ventral branches of L3тАУL4}; DISTRIBUTION={pectineus muscle, hip joint, obturator nerve}; MODALITY={general sensory and motor}
   * *obturator nerve, internal*; ORIGIN={ventral branches of ventral branches of L5, S1тАУS2}; DISTRIBUTION={posterior gemellus superior muscle and obturator internus muscle}; MODALITY={general sensory and motor}

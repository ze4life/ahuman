=== Abstract ===

  * key role in emotional processing:
   * ACA/posterior orbitofrontal cortex
   * HCA/anterior temporal sensory association areas
   * BGA/amygdala
  * *anterior temporal sensory and polymodal association cortices* send primarily feedforward projections to posterior orbitofrontal cortex
   * originate in supragranular layers
   * provide signals about external environment
  * *amygdala* innervates all layers of posterior orbitofrontal cortex
   * convey information about emotional context
  * *posterior orbitofrontal cortex* targets dual systems in amygdala which have opposite effects on central autonomic structures
   * to AM/inhibitory intercalated masses -> disinhibit central autonomic structures during emotional arousal
   * to AM/central nucleus -> autonomic homeostasis
   * depend on emotional context
  * *lateral prefrontal cortices* issue feedforward projections
   * target layer 5 of orbitofrontal cortex, which is chief output layer to amygdala

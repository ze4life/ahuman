=== Abstract ===

  * key role in emotional processing:
   * HCA/anterior temporal sensory association areas (ATS)
   * BGA/amygdala (AM)
   * ACA/posterior orbitofrontal cortex (OPFC)
  * *ATS and polymodal association cortices* send primarily feedforward projections to OPFC
   * originate in supragranular layers
   * provide signals about external environment
  * *AM* innervates all layers of OPFC
   * convey information about emotional context
  * *OPFC* targets dual systems in amygdala which have opposite effects on central autonomic structures
   * to AM/inhibitory intercalated masses -> disinhibit central autonomic structures during emotional arousal
   * to AM/central nucleus -> autonomic homeostasis
   * depend on emotional context
  * *lateral prefrontal cortices* (LPFC) issue feedforward projections to target layer 5 of OPFC, which is chief output layer to AM
  * sequential and collaborative interactions
   * evaluating the sensory and emotional aspects of the environment
   * decision and action in complex behaviour

=== Introduction ===

  * prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   * receives information from most of cerebral cortex and subcortical structures
   * handles only relevant task information at one time
  * choosing relevant information
   * must be conducted within emotional context that helps focus attention
   * we can handle common things automatically but alerted by some signals
   * article considers pathways of selective attention for emotional events among 3 structures - ATS, AM, OPFC
  * ATS robustly interlinked in tiad pathways with both OPFC and AM
   * integrate information on sensory features and emotional significance of events

=== Architecture of orbitofrontal cortex ===

http://ahuman.googlecode.com/svn/images/wiki/research/biomodel/opfc.jpg

  * each PFC area has unique *architectonic* features - size and the shape of neurons in individual layers
   * e.g. giant Betz cells in layer 5 characterize primary motor cortex
  * *cortical type* refers to broad structural features - number of layers, width and density of layer 4, overall neuronal density
   * unifies architectonically different areas into groups by common features
   * OPFC areas belong to 1-3 cortical types defined by number of layers
  * best descriptor of cortical type in PFC is *layer 4 neural density* - from agranular (lowest density) to granular (highest density)
  * another descriptor is distribution of *PV and CB inhibitory neurons*
   * agranular - highest CB, lowest PV
   * granular - average CB, PV
   * type 3 is most granular cortex type in OPFC
   * type 4 is in LPFC
  * caudal OPFC (OPAll, OFap)
   * samples entire sensory periphery through cortical connections
   * has strongest connections with limbic structures that process signals on the internal environment
   * has most robust and specialized connections with AM

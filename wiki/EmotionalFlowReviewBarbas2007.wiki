=== Abstract ===

  * key role in emotional processing:
   * ACA/posterior orbitofrontal cortex (OPFC)
   * HCA/anterior temporal sensory association areas (ATS)
   * BGA/amygdala (AM)
  * *ATS and polymodal association cortices* send primarily feedforward projections to OPFC
   * originate in supragranular layers
   * provide signals about external environment
  * *AM* innervates all layers of OPFC
   * convey information about emotional context
  * *OPFC* targets dual systems in amygdala which have opposite effects on central autonomic structures
   * to AM/inhibitory intercalated masses -> disinhibit central autonomic structures during emotional arousal
   * to AM/central nucleus -> autonomic homeostasis
   * depend on emotional context
  * *lateral prefrontal cortices* (LPFC) issue feedforward projections to target layer 5 of OPFC, which is chief output layer to AM
  * sequential and collaborative interactions
   * evaluating the sensory and emotional aspects of the environment
   * decision and action in complex behaviour

== Introduction ==

  * prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   * receives information from most of cerebral cortex and subcortical structures
   * handles only relevant task information at one time
  * choosing relevant information
   * must be conducted within emotional context that helps focus attention
   * we can handle common things automatically but alerted by some signals
   * article considers pathways of selective attention for emotional events among 3 structures - ATS, AM, OPFC

This page covers biological details of component Retroambigualis Nucleus.
Region is part of aHuman target integrated biological model.

  * *Top-down path to region*: Hindbrain Myelencephalon -> Expiratory Center (HMA.HM.RC) -> Retroambigualis Nucleus (HMA.HM.RA) (see [OverallMindMaps Mind Maps])
  * *Brain area*: [BrainAreaFMA Face Motor and Sensory Area]
  * *Role*: relay
  * *Function*: Groups of premotor interneurons producing detailed motor actions
  * *Notes to function*: Different combination of activation of these premotor neurons determines vocalization, vomiting, coughing, sneezing, mating posture, or child delivery

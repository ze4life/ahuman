== Signal propagation in Axon branches ==

  * see [http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v5/n4/box/nrn1397_BX1.html diameter-based metric] - GR=(c1d^3/2^+ c2d^3/2^)/pd^3/2^, signals spreads two-way if GR=1
  * collateral axon or axon collateral is branch off of main axon that usually feeds back onto soma
   * axon collateral can form synapses with nearby inhibitory neurons, it serves as a regulation system. Excitatory cells excite nearby inhibitory cells that prevent them from firing quite as often
   * axon collaterals bifurcate from primary axon segments at unmyelinated regions

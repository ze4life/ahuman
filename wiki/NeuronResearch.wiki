== Meaning of Neuron ==

  * Neuron is biological cell of complex structure and form
  * Neuron is building block of Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
  * Each neuron performs relay, calculation and memory functions
  * Neurons are of different types which allow neural regions to play various roles
  * Neuron is max of 0.1 mm width and can be up to 1m length
  * Neurons are surrounded by glia cells, which fed them and participate in neuron functions

== Neuron Structure and Sequence of Signal Transmission ==

  * neuron consists of several dendrites, one soma and one axon
  * soma relays and produces neurotransmitters, which allow neurons to build neural networks
  * soma produces spike - electrical wave, holding so called action potential which travels through axon to axon terminal, where it via neurotransmitter affects dendrite of another neuron
  * neurotransmitter substance excited by action potential makes certain effect on dendrite, by activating neurotransmitter-dependent receptors
  * chemical reaction in receptor affects membrane of soma
  * effect can be of 3 types - excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory, which defined by neurotransmitter
   * *excitatory* effect, e.g. from GLU, increases total membrane potential, which causes neuron to fire when potential is above specific threshold, it lasts about 20ms
   * *inhibitory* effect, e.g. from GABA, blocks neuron from firing within 150ms
   * *modulatory* effect is excitatory but much weaker and it only facilitates firing of neuron

== Signal propagation in Axon branches ==

  * see [http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v5/n4/box/nrn1397_BX1.html diameter-based metric] - GR=(c1d^3/2^+ c2d^3/2^)/pd^3/2^, signals spreads two-way if GR=1
  * collateral axon or axon collateral is branch off of main axon that usually feeds back onto soma
   * axon collateral can form synapses with nearby inhibitory neurons, it serves as a regulation system. Excitatory cells excite nearby inhibitory cells that prevent them from firing quite as often
   * axon collaterals bifurcate from primary axon segments at unmyelinated regions
  * thalamic neurons in retinogeniculate system lose approximately ten inputs for every one input that is maintained soon after birth

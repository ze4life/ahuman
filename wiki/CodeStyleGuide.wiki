== What is The Code Style and Why We Need It ==

  * Code style is the only way to share code
  * Good code style helps to develop complex programs

== Naming Convention ==

  * use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase as a direction
  * name variables, functions as __varName__, __doSelfDescriptiveAction__
  * name classes, enums, enum Items, structs as __!TypeName__
  * name constants, defines, as __MAXNAME__
  * name files in lower case, as __filename.h__
    # name headers by functional area, as __aidb.h__
    # name source files by class, use one file per class, as __nnlayer.cpp__

== Formatting ==

  * align function body with 8-char tabs
  * use spaces to delimit any text, except function name, from brackets and commas
  * use spaces before and after '='
  * use empty lines to delimit closely related groups of code lines (code block)

== Comments ==

  * use one-line comments for every code block
  * try write comments in such way that they represent sequential specification of function if delete the code
  * use area delimiter (see below) to split file into groups of functions of very different matter - e.g. header references, interface functions, internal implementation functions, standard interface implementation, such as Object

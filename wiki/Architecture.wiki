== Limitations ==

Feasibility Study gives us below limitations for aHuman design:

  * don't try to replicate human design
  * use high-quality model of NN with 1Kb memory per neuron
  * use NNs for personality areas and knowlets for others
  * use 500K neurons in operating memory (0.05% of HI)
  * use 30K focused neurons (6% of AI NNs)
  * develop knowlets as plug-ins
   * use up to 500M in operating memory for activated knowlets (0.5% of HI)
   * remaining inactive knowlets can use up to 100Gb disk space
  * separate feeling from emotions
  * treat feeling as internal motivation system
   * use broken Markov network as a "pain" body signal
   * use sensor data consumed to adjust Markov network as "feed" body signal
   * use expected action in Markov network as internal motivator
   * curiosity is exploration action in Markov network
   * derive new "uncertainty" body signal as mismatch between expected/suggested action and actual action
  * don't create Markov networks initially, create HMM factories to construct networks
  * create learning cycle based on body signals
   * construct body reward function from body signals
   * create system of feedback recognition, train it using body reward function
   * create feedback reward function as output of feedback recognition system
   * use feedback reward function to learn all active Markov networks

== Ideas inspired by coding ==

  * mind consists of mind areas
  * mind area consists of neural networks of various types
  * single AI component is responsible for specific area and defines how it is constructed from networks - shape, used network types, sizes and inter-area links
  * brain holds mind
  * brain defines how areas are connected
  * brain contains thread pool, executing elementary operations
  * elementary operation is either network input/output calculation or link walkthough
  * any operation leads to learning - either inside one network, or inside link
  * networks can be of small typical size - e.g. 300 neurons, and thread pool can be 100 threads executing their operations and then sleeping for a while
  * networks porcessed in the same time mean "mind focus"
  * after processing focus is changed

==Feature Description==

The system can learn through various interfaces exposed to the individual using thich the character of the ahuman will converge to the user who is using it. The interfaces can be:
 
  # Thought dairy of user, where he puts in his thoughts.
  # Plugin in browser to monitor the searches done by user.
  # A desktop application to monitor user activities as what task he mostly does.
  # Mobile application to monitor the mobile activities and the places he visit.
 
etc etc.
 
This data can be input to the system so that we can clasify the user to resemble to the user who is using it.
 
This way the ahuman can do lots of tasks which the real user intend to do on internet or in cyber space. e.g. Individual can write in thought dairy that he is going through final exams. Ahuman has information that user is doing engineering in computer science and he is studing what subjects. Ahuman can start the material collection online while user is sleeping or doing something else. he can extract the questions that are most common in subject and prepare final material for user to study. This way real user need not spend time on google to search for material.
 
Idea is to save the time we spend on google search. in the end we all strive for information and thats what sells.

I think this has hidden obstacles:

1. There is a significant challenge to have anything like "big brother" because of various spyware checkers, anti-viruses and very different and complex computer configurations
2. Generally people don't like background processes doing unknown things, and will not agree to sacrifice their own privacy.

Idea with diary is good but can be and better be implemented on server side - already now we have tendency to store data on the internet, not local PC.

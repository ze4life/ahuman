= Anything =

== Theory of Chaos ==

  * chaos is not random, but result of complex set of interactions, that are hard to calculate
  * different sorts of chaos has different level of disorder, most ordered chaos is named *chaotic attractors*
  * see http://www.rudyrucker.com/pdf/artificiallifelab.pdf

= Memory =

== Episodic Memory ==

  * motor learning requires many times to complete
  * after *episodic learning* we remember complex details very well though experienced only once
  * concatenate temporally-separated, multimodal stimuli and abstract concepts
   * things can be quite abstract
   * things can relate to different modalities
   * embedded in temporal context in which order is preserved
  * there is partial remembering
   * important events undergo *termed consolidation*
   * hippocampus is brain region where recent memories are initially stored
   * more important memories are transferred to cortical areas

== Refractory period ==

  * *refractory period* is transient phase just after firing during which it is either impossible or difficult to communicate with cell
  * can be decomposed into two phases:
   * *absolute* refractory period, which is constant period of time corresponding loosely to hyperpolarization of neuron during which is it impossible to excite or inhibit cell no matter how great stimulating current applied is
   * immediately after begins *relative* refractory period during which initiation of second action potential is inhibited but still possible (lasts 2ms)

== Constructing Regions ==

Source parameters:
  * input rectangular region of size X,Y
  * outputs is also some rectangle, where each item is probability of corresponding sequence
  * spacial factor defines how big are recognised spacial patterns 
  * temporal factor defines how long can be recognised sequence
  * depth factor defines how complex is spacial-temporal pattern

Sequences and Columns:
  * item corresponds to cortical column
  * column stores spacial-temporal sequence
  * until allocated (filled), column is empty or half-empty
  * column defines maximum sequence size
  * half-empty sequence can be recognised, not trying to enlarge - means supporting variable-length sequences
  * so column can be: empty, partial/full unrecognized/recognised
  * column is recognised if frequence is high enough
  * sequence can be forgotten by column

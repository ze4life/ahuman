== Constructing Regions ==

Source parameters:
  * input rectangular region of size X,Y
  * outputs is also some rectangle, where each item is probability of corresponding sequence

Mapping to Human Brain
  * item corresponds to cortical column
  * several regions

Implementation:
  * column stores spacial-temporal sequence
  * until allocated (filled), column is empty or half-empty
  * column defines maximum sequence size
  * reduced sequence can be recognised, not trying to enlarge
  * so column can be: empty, partial/full unrecognized/recognised
  * column is recognised if frequence is big enough
  * sequence can be forgotten by column

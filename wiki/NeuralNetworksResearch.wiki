Neural Network research covers finding algorithms for generic approximation, classification and clustering.

== Terms ==

From investigations and trying to be in a mainstream, below terms are born in Neural Networking (possibly will go to separate page in the future):

  * *neural variable* (NV): the entity, supported by mind
  * *neural network* (NN): system of connected neurons, translating one set of neural variables into another set of neural variables (NV-mapping)
  * *neural sensor*: one of external inputs for neural network, mapped to one neural variable
  * *neural target*: one of final outputs for neural network, mapped to one neural variable
  * *neural input*: scalar value, obtained by pre-processing of neural sensor before passing to NN internals. E.g. n-coded representing on discrete values, 2-dimensional sensors
  * *neural output*: scalar value, internal NN output, to be passed to post-processing to generate target variable

== Research targets ==

See research status grouped by target

== Create a core set of algorithms for generic classification and regression ==

PROBLEM:

  * Implement algorithms that learn any NV-mapping for nearly 100% cases
  * Make sure they will work limited time at a cost of precision

FINDINGS:

  * !QuickProp is good enough for batch training
  * Incremental training works, but slower
  * Auto-restart is required

TODO:
  * Add constructive algorithm

== Find best parameters for training algorithm ==

PROBLEM:

  * Most algorithm are very sensitive to parameters
  * Best values of parameters depend on NV-mapping

FINDINGS:

  * Simplified NN is created to learn from various samples
  * Samples are persisted to be reused for batch/cache algorithm

TODO:

  * Find what meta-information can help for choosing parameters values
  * Extend parameter-selection NN to use meta-information from variables

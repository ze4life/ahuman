Neural Network research covers new theory of neural networks. Unfortunately, old theory started 50 years ago, was mostly occupied by mathematicians who contribute to the theory without good understanding of new findings of biological sciences.

As a result we have large building of formulas and theorems, with a weak fundament of 50-year old knowledge of neural networks.
This building is unable to scale solved tasks, to explain human memory and features, it is mostly dedicated to so called "weak intelligence" - fitting Turing definition - it produces things that to some extent, in laboratory conditions, look like being intelligent, whilst it is just good mistification.

Theory of neural networks, besides of just explaining how the mind operates on lower level of details, should provide computational models to enable reproducing biological neural networks with IT methods.

New theory of neural networks should cover at least:

  * *neuron types* - pyramidal, stellate (there are total of 150 different types on neurons)
  * *types of inter-neuron connectivity* - e.g. pyramidal neuron has 1 (exactly one) apical neuron, set of distal neurons and set of proximal neurons

== Terms ==

From investigations and trying to be in a mainstream, below terms are born in Neural Networking (possibly will go to separate page in the future):

  * *neural variable* (NV): the entity, supported by mind
  * *neural network* (NN): system of connected neurons, translating one set of neural variables into another set of neural variables (NV-mapping)
  * *neural sensor*: one of external inputs for neural network, mapped to one neural variable
  * *neural target*: one of final outputs for neural network, mapped to one neural variable
  * *neural input*: scalar value, obtained by pre-processing of neural sensor before passing to NN internals. E.g. n-coded representing on discrete values, 2-dimensional sensors
  * *neural output*: scalar value, internal NN output, to be passed to post-processing to generate target variable

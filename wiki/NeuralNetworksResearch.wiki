Neural Network research covers understanding types of neural networks, constructing, evolving and linking networks.

== Terms ==

From investigations and trying to be in a mainstream, below terms are born in Neural Networking (possibly will go to separate page in the future):

  * *neural variable* (NV): the entity, supported by mind
  * *neural network* (NN): system of connected neurons, translating one set of neural variables into another set of neural variables (NV-mapping)
  * *neural sensor*: one of external inputs for neural network, mapped to one neural variable
  * *neural target*: one of final outputs for neural network, mapped to one neural variable
  * *neural input*: scalar value, obtained by pre-processing of neural sensor before passing to NN internals. E.g. n-coded representing on discrete values, 2-dimensional sensors
  * *neural output*: scalar value, internal NN output, to be passed to post-processing to generate target variable

----

== Sensor Area Inputs ==

  * primary input - external world properties captured by sensor
  * sensor control - origination of control data and nature of inter-area link - to be understood, see sections below
  * perception feedback - time-based expectation for sensory data from perception area

== Sensor Area Outputs ==

  * primary output - sensosory data, sent to perception area
  * control feedback - providing status of control command execution - executed completely or partially, or somehow in different way
  * exposed control state properties - emitted to external world to facilitate establishing direct communication channel with other subjects

== Sensor Area Inputs ==

  * *primary input* - external world properties captured by sensor
  * *sensor control* - origination of control data and nature of inter-area link - to be understood, see sections below
  * *perception feedback* - time-based expectation for sensory data from perception area

== Sensor Area Outputs ==

  * *primary output* - sensory data, sent to perception area
  * *control feedback* - providing status of control command execution - executed completely or partially, or somehow in different way
  * *exposed control state properties* - emitted to external world to facilitate establishing direct communication channel with other subjects

== Biological Eye Sensor Paths ==

  * *primary input*
   * light -> rods (fast colorless contrast low-resolution receptors)
   * light -> cones (slow R/G/B high-resolution receptors)
  * *sensor control*
   * prefrontal cortex/eye field -> BSA/superior colliculus -> BSA/horizontal gaze center
   * prefrontal cortex/eye field -> BSA/pretectum/horizontal gaze center
   * visual cortex/association cortex -> superior colliculus -> pretectum/horizontal gaze center
   * brain stem/midbrain/pretectum -> oculomotor, trochlear, abducent nerve (III, IV, VI cranial) -> pretectum/Edinger-Westphal nucleus -> ciliary ganglion -> eye

{code}
constriction of pupil, accommodation of lens
ciliary ganglion - parasympathetic ganglion
Edinger-Westphal nucleus - parasympathetic cranial nerve nucleus
{code}

  * *primary output*
   * rods/cones -> thalamus/LGN/1-6 (main relay) -> primary visual cortex
   * rods/cones -> superior colliculus (10%, 150K axons - initiates move to orient eye toward stimulus - place it from peripheral field to fovea/macula)
   * rods/cones -> pretectum (pupil resize and accommodation reflex)
   * rods/cones -> hypothalamus (synchronize biological rhythms)

== Linking Sensors to Perception - HLAv3 ==

  * *sensor/data* -> thalamus/input
  * thalamus/output -> perception/feed-forward-input
  * perception/feed-forward-output -> parietal/feed-forward-input
  * perception/feed-back-output -> thalamus/input
  * parietal/feed-forward-output -> *sensor/control*
  * parietal/feed-back-output -> perception/feed-back-input
  * *sensor/feedback* -> somatic/feed-forward-input
  * somatic/feed-forward-output -> parietal/feed-forward-input
  * somatic/feed-back-output -> parietal/feed-back-input

== Linking Sensors to Perception ==

  * for each sensor there is perception belief network for processing sensor data
   * several sensors are mapped to perception area
   * each sensor needs its own processing because of specific data format and patterns

== Interesting facts ==

  * when an animal attends to some features in its sensations, the neural representations even in the lowest cortical levels adapt mostly to those features and not to others

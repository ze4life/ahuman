== Sensor Area Inputs ==

  * primary input - external world properties captured by sensor
  * sensor control - origination of control data and nature of inter-area link - to be understood, see sections below
  * perception feedback - time-based expectation for sensory data from perception area

== Sensor Area Outputs ==

  * primary output - sensory data, sent to perception area
  * control feedback - providing status of control command execution - executed completely or partially, or somehow in different way
  * exposed control state properties - emitted to external world to facilitate establishing direct communication channel with other subjects

== Linking Sensors to Perception - HLAv3 ==

  * *sensor/data* -> thalamus/input
  * thalamus/output -> perception/feed-forward-input
  * perception/feed-forward-output -> parietal/feed-forward-input
  * perception/feed-back-output -> thalamus/input
  * parietal/feed-forward-output -> *sensor/control*
  * parietal/feed-back-output -> perception/feed-back-input
  * *sensor/feedback* -> somatic/feed-forward-input
  * somatic/feed-forward-output -> parietal/feed-forward-input
  * somatic/feed-back-output -> parietal/feed-back-input

== Linking Sensors to Perception ==

  * for each sensor there is perception belief network for processing sensor data
   * several sensors are mapped to perception area
   * each sensor needs its own processing because of specific data format and patterns

== Interesting facts ==

  * when an animal attends to some features in its sensations, the neural representations even in the lowest cortical levels adapt mostly to those features and not to others

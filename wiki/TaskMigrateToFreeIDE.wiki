#summary Task: Migrate To Eclipse

@@[Home] -> [ProjectPlanning] -> [TaskMigrateToEclipse]
----

==What==

  * Select proper IDE
  * Replace MSDEV build scripts with new ones
  * Attach Subversion plugin
  * Create default workspace settings
  * Migrate GUI project

==How==

  * After close look Eclipse has been rejected because it is much more Java, but has weaknesses for C++ - too slow, debug is unavailable
  * Codelite is chosen as next target IDE for migration

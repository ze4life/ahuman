== Thoracic Nerves ==

  * *musculocutaneous nerve*; ORIGIN={lateral cord of brachial PLEXUS-C5-C7}; BRANCHES={lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm, and muscular branches}; DISTRIBUTION={coracobrachial and biceps brachial muscles, the elbow joint, and skin of radial side of forearm}; MODALITY={general sensory and motor}
   * *cutaneous nerve of forearm, lateral*; ORIGIN={continuation of musculocutaneous nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={skin over radial side of forearm and sometimes an area of skin of dorsum of hand}; MODALITY={general sensory}
   * *musculocutaneous nerve of foot* (superficial fibular n.)
    * *cutaneous nerve of foot, intermediate dorsal*; ORIGIN={superficial fibular nerve}; BRANCHES={dorsal digital nerves of foot}; DISTRIBUTION={skin of front of lower third of leg and dorsum of foot, and skin and joints of adjacent sides of third and fourth, and of fourth and fifth toes}; MODALITY={general sensory}
     * *digital nerves of foot, dorsal*; ORIGIN={intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={skin and joints of adjacent sides of third and fourth, and of fourth and fifth toes}; MODALITY={general sensory}
    * *cutaneous nerve of foot, medial dorsal*; ORIGIN={superficial fibular nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={nerves supplying the third, fourth, and fifth toes, skin and joints of medial side of foot and big toe, and adjacent sides of second and third toes}; MODALITY={general sensory}
     * *sural nerve*; ORIGIN={medial sural cutaneous nerve and fibular communicating branch of common fibular nerve}; BRANCHES={lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve and lateral calcaneal branches}; DISTRIBUTION={skin on back of leg, and skin and joints on lateral side of heel and foot}; MODALITY={general sensory}
      * *cutaneous nerve of foot, lateral dorsal*; ORIGIN={continuation of sural nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={skin and joints of lateral side of foot and fifth toe}; MODALITY={general sensory}
   * *musculocutaneous nerve of leg* (deep fibular nerve)
    * *digital nerves of foot, dorsal*; ORIGIN={medial terminal division of deep fibular nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={nerves supplying the first and second toes, skin and joints of adjacent sides of great and second toes}; MODALITY={general sensory}
  * *intercostal nerves*; ORIGIN arise from anterior divisions (rami anteriores; ventral divisions) of the thoracic spinal nerves from T1 to T11}; BRANCHES={lateral cutaneous, anterior, posterior
   * *intercostobrachial nerves, lateral cutaneus branch* two nerves arising from the intercostal nerves and supplying the skin of the upper limb. 
    * *the first is constant: ORIGIN={second intercostal nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={skin on back and medial aspect of arm}; MODALITY={general sensory. 
    * *a second intercostobrachial nerve is often present; ORIGIN={third intercostal nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={skin of axilla and medial aspect of arm}; MODALITY={general sensory}
   * *anterior branches* run forward to the side and the forepart of the chest, supplying the skin and the mamma; those of the fifth and sixth nerves supply the upper digitations of the Obliquus externus abdominis}
   * *posterior branches* run backward, and supply the skin over the scapula and Latissimus dorsi.run forward the side two way side of the muscular supply
  * *splanchnic nerve*
   * *splanchnic nerve, greater*; ORIGIN={thoracic sympathetic trunk and fifth through tenth thoracic GANGLIA}; DISTRIBUTION={descending through the diaphragm or its aortic openings, ends in celiac ganglia and plexuses, with a splanchnic ganglion commonly occurring near the diaphragm}; MODALITY={preganglionic sympathetic and visceral afferent}
   * *splanchnic nerve, lesser*; ORIGIN={ninth and tenth thoracic GANGLIA of sympathetic trunk}; BRANCHES={renal branch}; DISTRIBUTION={pierces the diaphragm, joins the aorticorenal ganglion and celiac plexus, and communicates with the renal and superior mesenteric plexuses}; MODALITY={preganglionic sympathetic and visceral afferent}
    * *splanchnic nerve, lowest*; ORIGIN={last GANGLION of sympathetic trunk or lesser splanchnic nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={aorticorenal ganglion and adjacent plexus}; MODALITY={sympathetic and visceral afferent}
  * *thoracic nerve*
   * *thoracic nerve, long*; ORIGIN={brachial PLEXUS (ventral branches of C5-C7)}; DISTRIBUTION={descends behind brachial plexus to serratus anterior muscle}; MODALITY={motor}
    * *subcostal nerve*; ORIGIN={anterior branch of twelfth thoracic nerve}; DISTRIBUTION={skin of lower abdomen and lateral side of gluteal region, parts of abdominal transverse, oblique, and rectus muscles, and usually the pyramidal muscle, and adjacent peritoneum}; MODALITY={general sensory and motor}
   * *thoracodorsal nerve*; ORIGIN={posterior cord of brachial PLEXUS (C7тАУC8)}; DISTRIBUTION={latissimus dorsi muscle}; MODALITY={motor}

This page covers biological details of component Dorsolateral Cornu Ammonis of Hippocampus.
Region is part of aHuman target integrated biological model.

  * *Top-down path to region*: Forebrain Telencephalon -> Hippocampal Formation (HBA.FT.HF) -> Hippocampus (HBA.FT.HC) -> Dorsolateral Cornu Ammonis of Hippocampus (HBA.FT.HC.CA2)(see [OverallMindMaps Mind Maps])
  * *Brain area*: [BrainAreaHBA Hippocampus Basal Area]
  * *function*: Gate controlled by the activity of the supramammillary nucleus to control signal propagation between HC lamines
  * *Notes to function*: Hippocampus. Receives theta rithm input from Septum Nucleus

= Components =

|| *Component Code* || *Component Name* || *Function* || *Comments* ||
|| *FBA.MM.RP.DRN* || Dorsal Raphe Nucleus || Regulation of sleep and mood || Major source of 5HT ||
|| *FBA.MM.PAG* || Periaqueductal Gray Matter || Descending modulation of pain and in defensive behaviour || ||
|| *FBA.MM.CNF* || Cuneiform Nucleus || Passive coping strategy to novel, painful or threatening stimuli || ||
|| *FBA.HP.RP.PRN* || Pontine Raphe Nucleus || Regulation of sleep cycle || Projects to CR, forebrain ||
|| *FBA.HP.RP.LI* || Nucleus Linearis || Release of 5-HT was only obtained on stimulation of this nucleus || Does not project to CR, but to forebrain ||
|| *FBA.HP.RP.MRN* || Superior Central Raphe Nucleus || Hallucinations || Insomnia ||
|| *FBA.HP.NI* || Incertus Nucleus || Behavioural activation and the response to stress || modulating influences on prefrontal and hippocampal cortical activity, midline behavior control ||
|| *FBA.HP.LC* || Locus Coeruleus || Regulate the intensity of responses to salient stimuli || NE Source, enhance signal-to-noise ratio, suppressing irrelevant stimuli (lateral inhibition) ||
|| *FBA.HM.RP* || Raphe Nucleus of Medulla || Regulate moods, temper anxiety, and relieve depression || Releases 5HT (serotonin) hormone (happiness) ||

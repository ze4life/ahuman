|| *Component ID* || *Component Name* || *Type* || *Function* || *Comments* ||
|| *FBA.MM.RP.MRN* || Median Raphe Nucleus || Inhibitory Nucleus || Block or temporarily suspend mnemonic processes in the hippocampus || Directs HC to disregard insignificant events ||
|| *FBA.MM.RP.DRN* || Dorsal Raphe Nucleus || Inhibitory Nucleus || Regulation of sleep and mood || Major source of 5HT ||
|| *FBA.MM.PAG* || Periaqueductal Gray Matter || Modulatory Nucleus || Descending modulation of pain and in defensive behaviour ||  ||
|| *FBA.MM.CNF* || Cuneiform Nucleus || Modulatory Nucleus || Passive coping strategy to novel, painful or threatening stimuli ||  ||
|| *FBA.MM.VTA* || Ventral Tegmental Area || Excitatory Nucleus || Respond to novel stimuli, unexpected rewards, and reward predictive sensory cues ||  ||
|| *FBA.HP.RP.PRN* || Pontine Raphe Nucleus || Inhibitory Nucleus || Regulation of sleep cycle || Projects to CR, forebrain ||
|| *FBA.HP.RP.LI* || Nucleus Linearis || Excitatory Nucleus || Release of 5-HT was only obtained on stimulation of this nucleus || Does not project to CR, but to forebrain ||

|| *FBA.HP.NI* || Incertus Nucleus || Modulatory Nucleus || Behavioural activation and the response to stress || Modulating influences on prefrontal and hippocampal<BR>cortical activity, midline behavior control ||
|| *FBA.HP.LC* || Locus Coeruleus || Inhibitory Nucleus || Regulate the intensity of responses to salient stimuli || NE Source, enhance signal-to-noise ratio,<BR>suppressing irrelevant stimuli (lateral inhibition) ||
|| *FBA.HM.RP* || Raphe Nucleus of Medulla || Inhibitory Nucleus || Regulate moods, temper anxiety, and relieve depression || Releases 5HT (serotonin) hormone (happiness) ||

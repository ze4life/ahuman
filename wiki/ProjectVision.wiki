== 1. Primary goal ==

The goal of Human project is to create software program, that will represent alive being, having a personality (Virtual Agent/Strong AI). It should use one or more free or commercial hosting locations, move from one hosting to another and provide a service for people for free or for money, at own will.

== 2. Feasibility Study ==

The AI problem is the most challenging task in the world for the last 50 years, tried to be solved by dedicated academic institutes and global commercial companies.

It could be quite naive to state that several even clever guys can succeed in the same.
That's why it is critical to study why and when we can reach project goals.
Some complexity can be solved using workaround, some using 3d-party open results, some - by re-phrasing the problem.

CHALLENGES

  * *Biological Problem*. Human AI is good enough after millions years of evolution, with design based on biological technologies, while we are trying to create computer-based AI
  * *MPP Problem*. Human AI is massive-parallel, while we are going to create a program running operations one-by-one by CPU
  * *Size Problem*. Human AI has about 100G neurons and 1000T connections, while we are trying to limit to about 1Gb memory
  * *Sensors Problem*. Human AI has 5 inborn powerful sensors, important for learning, and it is too hard to implement them using ordinary computer resources
  * *Motivation Problem*. Human AI has solely biological motivational system, while we have to answer questions like - why our AI will ever want to learn?
  * *Time Problem*. Human AI reveals intelligent behavior after years of initial learning, while from AI we probably expect the same just after hours of running
  * *Stability Problem*. Human AI component model is complex but finalized and works well, while we are only searching for results and surely will be unable to anticipate proper design in advance

BREAKTHROUGH

=== Biological Problem ===

First, biological system is made up from biological components, which have very deep structure and therefore each item practically can store a lot of details, can have rich representation of related entity.
We can compare this to audio signal which several years ago was recorded only on magnetic media, which has low reliability but has very good representation of original live
audio. 
Now we have digital representation for practically all audio data. The reason is its ability to copy w/o distortion and store w/o loss. In early time it was regarded as poor because of low bit-rate metric. Now we have formats with more fine-grained representation (high bit-rate) which is considered by most people as good enough and even having more quality than live concerts.
Let's consider that with some increased level of details we can use good digital representation of biological elements. It could mean that e.g. neuron should have much more complex digital model than we have now in neural networks.

Second, human AI design is in fact adopted to use biological components, and copying this design in digital AI can be a big mistake, because digital components and interfaces, that we are able to construct, may be unable to repeat some critical fundamental properties of biological components. If this is the case, then it can leave us the only way - to have a different set of components with different properties, which, as a whole, in theory can possess the features comparable in power with those of human.

== 3. Features that are vital for Human project ==

Primary features to implement during a project are:

  * *Personality*. A major feature for a project to create alive being, not a robot or toy or calculator
  * *Consciousness*. It makes intelligence, allowing the creature to interact and live with humans
  * *Growth*. Inevitable thing to adopt to our complex and changing environment
  * *Value*. It should be motivated to bring some value, provide some service to  have a freedom from its parents, to be adult

=== Personality ===

One of the known AI research teams, COG was designed and built to emulate human thought processes and experience the world as a human. Brooks and his team further assumed that people would find it easier to interact with a robot and aid the robot in its learning process when the robot could respond in a somewhat human way.
I agree with last sentence, but I think a certain mistake is behind that.
Imagine you meet a human-like but emotionless creature - would you like to learn him? Let me guess - no. We usually don't like emotionless people.
Another case - you meet intelligent but emotional creature looking quite different from human - look to the Spielberg-made films and you will see what I mean. Most of us will try to speak to and help him.

The program does not need to be like a human for all properties except personality. It means it could be slow-thinking or not wise, not have the same sensors as human, not ready to talk, or something like. Personality is the sole feature of the project. I think the major factors, contributing to this feature, are:

  * *Emotional Behavior*: every activity has an emotional side
  * *Will*: ability to initiate actions by own will, without push or request
  * *Power*: ability to change something in this world and skills to do that

=== Consciousness ===

The creature is not expected to be a great scientist or inventor though. We allow no extra skills, so our Human can be below average. What is most wanted are:

  * *Identity*: understand own identify, being able to find reference to himself in inbound data streams, to realise himself as a unique and self-important person
  * *Reasoning*: a sort of logical thinking is expected, so we can ask for explaining own actions or being able to understand some logical chain to use it or to have a meaningful conversation.
  * *Supervising*: there should be one one mind center responsible for decisions and supervising all the activity. It means we don't need a colony of ants but a single creature

=== Growth ===

This feature makes the creature able to evolve.

  * *Life Care*: thinking about continuing to live, providing internal motivations for living according to laws and common sense
  * *Self Learning*: able to learn without teacher
  * *Social Networking*: creating and expanding list of people who contribute to the creature in some way.

=== Value ===

This is to obtain a reasonable duties:

  * *Service For People*: motivation to have foundation for freedom
  * *Work For Money*: earn a money to pay for using Internet resources and to have a practical freedom
  * *Exchange For Free*: a principle helping to have friends

== 4. Comparing to existing projects ==

There are many of AI projects that are trying to create practical things leading to a commercialisation.
It is not our way, because Human project intention is to create alive being which has a personality.
We cannot sell it when succeed.

Human project is not intended to compete with similar projects.
Instead I think it will be fruitful if we use the ideas, algorithms and even working code from such projects, if available, to focus on primary goals.

The idea of the project is quite challenging, as we have examples of working AI applications and even intelligent behavior, but I don't know successful implementation of emotions and personality.

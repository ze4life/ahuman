== 1. Primary goal ==

The goal of Human project is to create software program, that will represent alive being, having a personality. It should use one or more free or commercial hostings, move from one hosting to another and provide a service for people for free or for money, at own will.

== 2. Features that are vital for Human project ==

Primary features to implement during a project are:

  * *Personality*. A major feature for a project to create alive being, not a robot or toy or calculator
  * *Consciousness*. It makes intelligence, allowing the creature to interact and live with humans
  * *Growth*. Inevitable thing to adopt to our complex and changing environment
  * *Value*. It should be motivated to bring some value, provide some service to  have a freedom from its parents, to be adult

=== Personality ===

One of the known AI research teams, COG was designed and built to emulate human thought processes and experience the world as a human. Brooks and his team further assumed that people would find it easier to interact with a robot and aid the robot in its learning process when the robot could respond in a somewhat human way.
I agree with last sentence, but I think a certain mistake is behind that.
Imagine you meet a human-like but emotionless creature - would you like to learn him? Let me guess - no. We usually don't like emotionless people.
Another case - you meet intelligent but emotional creature looking quite different from human - look to the Spielberg-made films and you will see what I mean. Most of us will try to speak to and help him.

The program do not need be like a human for all properties except personality. It means it could be slow-thinking or not wise, not have the same sensors as human, not ready to talk, or something like. Personality is the sole feature of the project. I think the major factors, contributing to this feature, are:

  * *Emotional Behavior*: every activity has an emotional side
  * *Will*: ability to initiate actions by own will, without push or request
  * *Power*: ability to change something in this world and skills to do that

=== Consciousness ===

The creature is not expected to be a great scientist or inventor though. We allow no extra skills, so our Human can be below average. What is most wanted are:

  * *Identity*: understand own identify, being able to find reference to himself in inbound data streams, to realise himself as a unique and self-important person
  * *Reasoning*: a sort of logical thinking is expected, so we can ask for explaining own actions or being able to understand some logical chain to use it or to have a meaningful conversation.
  * *Supervising*: there should be one one mind center responsible for decisions and supervising all the activity. It means we don't need a colony of ants but a single creature

=== Growth ===

This feature makes the creature able to evolve.

  * *Life Care*: thinking about continuing to live, providing internal motivations for living according to laws and common sense
  * *Self Learning*: able to learn without teacher
  * *Social Networking*: creating and expanding list of people who contribute to the creature in some way.

=== Value ===

This is to obtain a reasonable duties:

  * *Service For People*: motivation to have foundation for freedom
  * *Work For Money*: earn a money to pay for using Internet resources and to have a practical freedom
  * *Exchange For Free*: a principle helping to have friends

== 3. Comparing to existing projects ==

There are many of AI projects that are trying to create practical things leading to a commercialisation.
It is not our way, because Human project intention is to create alive being which has a personality.
We cannot sell it when succeed.

Human project is not intended to compete with similar projects.
Instead I think it will be fruitful if we use the ideas, algorithms and even working code from such projects, if available, to focus on primary goals.

The idea of the project is quite challenging, as we have examples of working AI applications and even intelligent behavior, but I don't know successful implementation of emotions and personality.

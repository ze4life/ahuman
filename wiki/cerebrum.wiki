Functions of cerebrum in biological brain and its implementation in software.

= Introduction =

Cerebrum perform various tasks in the human brain. Some of them are mentioned below.

    * Frontal Lobe- associated with reasoning, planning, parts of speech, movement, emotions, and problem solving
    * Parietal Lobe- associated with movement, orientation, recognition, perception of stimuli
    * Occipital Lobe- associated with visual processing
    * Temporal Lobe- associated with perception and recognition of auditory stimuli, memory, and speech


= Details =

  * *Occipital Lobe:* - It is associated with the vision of the humans. We can use some open source library to implement the vision of Ahuman as well as face recognition and detection. openCV seems to be choice to implement this, this library is written in C/C++ and developed by intel. Its used widely for computer vision.
     * Todo: Research to find what all can be done using this library.

= FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF INNERVATION =

  * see http://musom.marshall.edu/anatomy/grosshom/z_cranerv1.html

*General Innervation ‑ like spinal cord*:
  * *GSE* (General Somatic Efferent) ‑ motor to somatic voluntary skeletal muscles (derived from somites)
  * *GSA* (General Somatic Afferent) ‑ sensory to skin, joints, muscle and tendon receptor endings, nasal and oral cavity
  * *GVE* (General Visceral Efferent) = Autonomic Efferents ‑ motor to smooth muscles in general and smooth muscles of  skin (arrector pilae muscles) and blood vessels, secretomotor to glands
  * *GVA* (General Visceral Afferent) ‑ sensory to gut and its derivatives, pharynx, blood vessels, glands and internal organs

*Special Innervation ‑ only found in head*:
  * *SSA* (Special Somatic  Afferent) ‑ special senses of vision, auditory sensation and vestibular apparatus
  * *SVA* (Special Visceral Afferents) ‑ chemical senses of taste and by analogy smell
  * *SVE* (Special Visceral Efferents) ‑ motor to voluntary skeletal muscles derived from branchial arches (these muscles develop in association with pharynx, which is rostral end of gut and therefore visceral)

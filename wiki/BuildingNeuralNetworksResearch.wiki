== Biological Neural Networks ==

  * brain consists of *gray matter* and *white matter*
   * gray matter is mostly collection of neurons
   * white matter is mostly collection of mielynated axons
  * gray matter can be in form of *cortex* or *nucleus*
   * in cortex neurons are layered
   * in nucleus neurons are organized like cashew nuts inside a bowl
  * cortex can be of different types
   * *neocortex*, often called *cerebral cortex*
   * allocortex
   * mesocortex

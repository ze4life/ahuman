This page covers biological details of component Intralaryngeal Peripheral Ganglion.
Region is part of aHuman target integrated biological model.

  * *Top-down path to region*: Peripheral Nervous System -> Parasympathetic Ganglia (PN.PSYM) -> Intralaryngeal Peripheral Ganglion (AVA.PN.PSYM.ILG) (see [OverallMindMaps Mind Maps])
  * *Brain area*: [BrainAreaAVA Autonomous Visceral Area]
  * *Role*: parasympathetic
  * *Function*: parasympathetic motor of larynx,  c.n. X
  * *Notes to function*: macroscopic ganglion on the human internal laryngeal nerve, with the distribution of its post-ganglionic fibres to the glands in the saccule and to the glands at the root of epiglottis in the vicinity of the opening of the saccule

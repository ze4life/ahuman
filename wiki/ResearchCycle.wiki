== Research in Human Project ==

After several years of running aHuman project it became clear that research is very important part of the project.

Definitely, aHuman is related to coding, without access to expensive equipment, neurobiological procedures and owful technologies like lesion stufy or staining methods.

The approach of aHuman development uses the fact that biological mind architecture is virtually the same in human and monkey, cat and rat with minor differences. In the same time it is the only scheme which produces conscious alive beings on Earth.

  * It leads to the statement that there are 2 ways to build aHuman - using some newly invented approach and repeating human model.
When having strong intentions to build not a toy or calculator and above considerations, aHuman project inevitably selected more reliable way of following biological human architecture.

  * Unfortunately, nobody understands how human architecture works.
Nobody understands what set of components comprises this architecture, what interactions occurs among these components and for what function.

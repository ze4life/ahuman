== Research in Human Project ==

*Research Dilemma*

After several years of running aHuman project it became clear that research is very important part of the project.

  * definitely, aHuman is related to coding, without access to expensive equipment, neurobiological procedures and owful technologies like lesion stufy or staining methods.
  * the approach of aHuman development uses the fact that biological mind architecture is virtually the same in human and monkey, cat and rat with minor differences
  * in the same time it is the only scheme which produces conscious alive beings on Earth

*Research Tasks*

It leads to the statement that there are 2 ways to build aHuman - using some newly invented approach and repeating human model. When having strong intentions to build not a toy or calculator and above considerations, aHuman project inevitably selected more reliable way of following biological human architecture.

  * unfortunately, nobody understands how human architecture works
  * nobody understands exact set of components comprising this architecture, what interactions occurs among these components and for what functions
  * nevertheless, neurobiology exists for several centuries and up to the moment neuroscience has collected mountains of data for components, connectivity and functional implications
  * for the purpose of structuring the area is divided into 3 layes - macro-curcuits (e.g. voluntary memovemnts), local-circuits (like neocortical processing) and neural processing (like excitation or inhibition)

*Research in aHuman project is aimed to:*

  * build biological model with respect to aHuman targets
  * project biological model to aHuman targets

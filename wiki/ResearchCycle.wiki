== Research in aHuman Project ==

*Research Dilemma*

After several years of running aHuman project it became clear that research is very important part of the project.

  * definitely, aHuman is related to coding, without access to expensive equipment, neurobiological procedures and owful technologies like lesion stufy or staining methods.
  * the approach of aHuman development uses the fact that biological mind architecture is virtually the same in human and monkey, cat and rat with minor differences
  * in the same time it is the only scheme which produces conscious alive beings on Earth

*Research Tasks*

It leads to the statement that there are 2 ways to build aHuman - using some newly invented approach and repeating human model. When having strong intentions to build not a toy or calculator and above considerations, aHuman project inevitably selected more reliable way of following biological human architecture.

  * unfortunately, nobody understands how human architecture works
  * nobody understands exact set of components comprising this architecture, what interactions occurs among these components and for what functions
  * nevertheless, neurobiology exists for several centuries and up to the moment neuroscience has collected mountains of data for components, connectivity and functional implications
  * for the purpose of structuring the area is divided into 3 layes - macro-curcuits (e.g. voluntary movements), local circuits (like neocortical processing) and neural processing (like excitation or inhibition)

It is important to understand that research in aHuman project differs from scientific research:

  * expected that aHuman researcher does not create new neurobiological facts, but reuses existing ones publicly available
  * expected that aHuman researcher makes reasonable assumptions regarding validity of facts found
  * expected that aHuman researcher selects the best of existing sources when collecting data
  * expected that aHuman researcher combines facts and promising ideas from various sources in single consistent view

*Research in aHuman project is aimed to:*

  * build biological model with respect to aHuman targets
  * project biological model to aHuman targets

== Research Steps ==

  * start with identifying the theme with short well-defined name and position in the whole aHuman project research
  * create page which will be primary page of research, in almost all cases it will be the only page
  * link created page from one of aHuman research framework pages
  * rewrite framework directory if required - after informing owner of related page
  * prepare page structure - heading section to facilitate navigation, Diagrams, References
  * collect information, trying to limit text to minimum, preferring referencing good diagrams
  * used sources should be linked in References section
  * finally research ends with having specific content sections which present the model of considered fenomenon in short and useful form
  * model explained should allow implementation - expected that all non-technical challengeable questions regarding the theme have been answered
  * let know the owner of related upper framework page about finishing the research

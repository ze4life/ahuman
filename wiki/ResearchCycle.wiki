== Research in Human Project ==

It would be great if the researchers will make something under umbrella of Human project. In the same time my intentions are much more specific. I know that many ideas regarding artificial intelligence and neural networking have already been created.

Let's make a next step - just accumulate AI knowledge and shift a focus from industrial or military precise AI solutions to less predictable but much more attractive creature that can live without our support.
It poses a certain challenge, as shifts from today's "practical" applications.

That's why I expect that research will mostly be related to implementation and combination of known approaches, making useful and systemised collection of research results achieved across the world and make them open and useful for those who are interested in the matter.

== Research Scope ==

  * Research has goals related to the codebase
  * Research results are not planned to merge into the codebase
  * Primary limitation for the research is that it should be explicitly triggered by certain development task or, if successful, leads to practical task, which researcher is ready to identify before the research has started
  * Primary research areas are now [SensorsResearch] and [NeoCortexResearch]. First gives the input to and works in close cooperation with the second. Natural-like sensor gives aHuman required grounding to build true AI, while neocortex seems a clue to AI. Only after having reasonable approach to intelligence, other [ArtificialLifeResearch] research areas will be active - like feelings and personality

== Classical Research ==

  * on some level of abstraction aHuman definitely requires a quite intensive research - [ArtificialIntelligenceResearch Artificial Intelligence Research]. I have some ideas on the subject and I'm sure that well-elaborated neural networks can serve as low-level building blocks for this purpose. 
  * adjusting neural networking methods for specific AI tasks in Human project poses another challenge and establishes separate research area - [NeuralNetworksResearch Neural Networks Research].

== Research Steps ==

  # Identify the need for research
  # Register research task on research area page, start corresponding subpage on Wiki, named as corresponding task
  # Create research sandbox in $/research/<task name>
  # Run the research, adding your findings or working code to sandbox repository or Wiki research page
  # Describe the research results on research Wiki, expected follow-ups
  # Create/Open tasks that are follow-ups of this research

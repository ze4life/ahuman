This page covers biological details of component Sacral Parasympathetic Nucleus.
Region is part of aHuman target integrated biological model.

  * *Top-down path to region*: Spinal Cord -> Intermediate Zone (SC.IZ) -> Lamina VII (SC.IZ.L7) -> Intermediolateral Column (AVA.SC.IZ.IMLC) -> Sacral Parasympathetic Nucleus (AVA.SC.IZ.SPS) (see [OverallMindMaps Mind Maps])
  * *Brain area*: [BrainAreaAVA Autonomous Visceral Area]
  * *Role*: relay
  * *Function*: parasympathetic impulses pass via postganglionic fibers to the urinary bladder, erectile tissues, and the smooth muscles and glands in the colon and rectum
  * *Notes to function*: from Lamina VII, visceral parasympathetic

This page covers biological details of component Nucleus Linearis.
Region is part of aHuman target integrated biological model.

  * *Top-down path to region*: Hindbrain Metencephalon -> Pontine Reticular Formation (HP.RF) -> Pontine Reticular Formation, Midline Column (HP.RF.MID) -> Raphe Nuclei of Pons (FBA.HP.RP) -> Nucleus Linearis (LMC.HP.RP.LI) (see [OverallMindMaps Mind Maps])
  * *Type*: nucleus
  * *Brain area*: [BrainAreaLMC Lower Brain - Modulatory Contol Area]
  * *Role*: relay
  * *Function*: Release of 5-HT was only obtained on stimulation of this nucleus
  * *Notes to function*: Does not project to CR, but to forebrain

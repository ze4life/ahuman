Artificial Life research covers finding features and implementation approaches which create difference between living creature and machine, disregarding its intelligence.

=== Living Features ===

  * self-replication
  * self-assembly
  * self-organization
  * metabolism
  * adaptation
  * evolution

=== Complex Adaptive System Features ===

  * emergence (interaction in non-planned way)
  * co-evolution (with environment)
  * sub-optimality (trade off increased efficiency in favor of greater effectiveness)
  * requisite variety (strength from variety)
  * connectivity (relations more important than components)
  * simple rules (not complicated)
  * iteration (small changes can have significant effect)
  * self-organizing (no planning, hierarchy and control)
  * edge of chaos (dynamic enough to respond to environment)
  * nested systems

=== 1. Introduction to Artificial Life ===

  * What is Life (hydro-carbon chains?)
  * what is Intelligence (faculty of thought and reason?)
  * What is Artificial Life
   * man-made, not unreal
   * bottom-up, not top-down (means emerging from low-level interaction)
   * life "as it is", and "as it might be"
  * "Artificial" is related to components, not to emergent processes
  * "Big" claim that proper primitives with human-like functions will support process, that will be "alive" in the same meaning as for natural organisms (WRONG INTENTION FROM MY POINT OF VIEW - if we repeat human, it will be just a human - and we already know how to repeat human)
  * Applications:agent-based modeling (consumer markets, traffic flow), robotics, artificial worlds
  * Mind parts
   * Visual cortex / Occipital lobe / Parietal lobe / Primary auditory cortex / Temporal lobe / Somatic sensory cortex
   * Frontal lobe / Vocalization / Vocalization region of motor area / Motor area (precentral gyrus) - leg, arm, face / Supplementary motor area
   * Central sulcus / Broca's area / Sylvian tissue / Wernicke's area / Angular gyrus / Arcuate fasciculus
  * Damage of Occipital lobe leads to inability to dream
  * Damage of Visual cortex leads to lack of depth perception and inability to assemble parts into whole

  * Motor Cortex Map:
   * Toes / Ankle / Knee / Hip / Trunk / Shoulder / Elbow / Wrist / Hand
   * Fingers: Little / Ring / Middle / Index / Thumb
   * Neck / Brow / Eyelid and eyeball / Face
   * Vocalization: Lips / Jaw / Tongue / Swallowing
  * ANNs capture key features of biological neural networks (connectionism) using:
   * Hebbian learning
   * Suitable wiring diagram
  * How to proceed
   * Genetic Algorithms (computational realm)
   * Natural Selection (biological realm)
   * Any little niche, survive, reproduce, adopt to changes
   * Provide suitably rich physics, adequate energy
   * Use biologically inspired models: rich genetic structure, ontogeny (process), environment, invoke evolution, wait
  * We are our bodies and it is a process, not substrate
  * Machine intelligence not equal to natural intelligence

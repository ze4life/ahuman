Artificial Life research covers finding features and implementation approaches which create difference between living creature and machine, disregarding its intelligence.

== Research Targets ==

  * [Feelings] - Source and nature of feeliengs
  * [EmotionsAnalysis] - Emotion Analysis

== System of Motivation ==

  * ventral pallidum computes how much reward is at stake, and sustains activity in cortical motor areas driving muscular contractions
  * this may happen even when a person has no idea of how much reward to expect
  * ventral pallidum therefore seems to be a key node in brain circuits that underpin both conscious and subliminal motivation

== Mind Algorithms ==

  * sequence completion
  * hierarchical clustering
  * retrieval trees
  * hash coding
  * compression
  * time dilation
  * reinforcement learning

== Interesting pictures ==

== Features ==

=== Categories ===

Can be useful approach, to regard all proposed features by categories:

  * biological features (in Soft Artificial Life we don't need these features)
  * alive features
  * intelligent features

=== Critical properties of living and life-like systems ===

As per http://www.alife12.org/themes/:

  * self-replication / biological
  * self-assembly / biological
  * self-organization / alive (alive matter should be flexible - hence stable)
  * metabolism / interesting question! - it is half of internal motivation system
  * adaptation / we have evidence for biological, intelligent adaptation. re alive adaptation - we can say "in this environment he became less alive" - so yes, applicable
  * evolution / biological

*finally*:
  * it is more about biological life

=== Complex Adaptive System Features ===

As per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system:

  * emergence (interaction in non-planned way) / alive
  * co-evolution (with environment) / see adaptation and evolution in above
  * sub-optimality (trade off increased efficiency in favor of greater effectiveness) / alive
  * requisite variety (strength from variety) / biological
  * connectivity (relations more important than components) / alive
  * simple rules (not complicated) / alive
  * iteration (small changes can have significant effect) / alive
  * self-organizing (no planning, hierarchy and control) / alive
  * edge of chaos (dynamic enough to respond to environment) / alive
  * nested systems / biological

*finally*:
  * it is more about universal life, both artificial and biological

=== Love Feature ===

Interesting idea:

  * will we say one is alive individual being if able to love? - definitely yes
  * can we say one is alive individual being if not able to love by design? - probably no, cos no examples in our life
  * sort of Sigmund Freud's thoughts:
   * love is feeling
   * love is man to woman (social/intelligence, sexual/body motivation, instinct/evolution, dependency)
   * love is man or woman to own child (social, instinct, dependency)
   * love is man to man or woman to woman (social, sexual)
   * love is human to pet (social, dependency/ownership)
   * love is human to thing, e.g. own car (ownership)

*finally*:
  * all you need is love
  * any type of love is projection (perversion) of man to woman love

== Growth ==

=== Stages of human development ===

As per http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/MindAndIntelligence.html:

  * Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner have both demonstrated, cleverly and effectively, the multiplicity of human thought. That is, our thought processes may be shown to be composed of, at least, three distinct modes of reasoning. 
  * Though there is some argument as to the precise ages of transition, Piaget demonstrated that children pass through:
   * *kinesthetic* (or body-learning) stage of development, followed by 
   * *iconic* (or visual) stage, finally graduating to 
   * *symbolic* (or logical) stage
  * In each stage, Piaget demonstrated that later stages were largely inaccessible to the child, and earlier stages were largely ignored. 
  * Bruner demonstrated that while these three modes of thought were indeed present and dominant during these three phases of development, all three modes of thought were present throughout the child's growth, and any of the modes is accessible if the dominant mode can merely be distracted for a time.
  * Alan Kay has said, "Doing with images makes symbols." That is, physical interaction with visual feedback will produce logical understanding.

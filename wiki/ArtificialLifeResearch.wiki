Artificial Life research covers finding features and implementation approaches which create difference between living creature and machine, disregarding its intelligence.

=== Living Features ===

  * self-replication
  * self-assembly
  * self-organization
  * metabolism
  * adaptation
  * evolution

=== Complex Adaptive System Features ===

  * emergence (interaction in non-planned way)
  * co-evolution (with environment)
  * sub-optimality (trade off increased efficiency in favor of greater effectiveness)
  * requisite variety (strength from variety)
  * connectivity (relations more important than components)
  * simple rules (not complicated)
  * iteration (small changes can have significant effect)
  * self-organizing (no planning, hierarchy and control)
  * edge of chaos (dynamic enough to respond to environment)
  * nested systems

=== 1. Introduction to Artificial Life ===

  * What is Life (hydro-carbon chains?)
  * What is Intelligence (faculty of thought and reason?)
  * What is Artificial Life
   * man-made, not unreal
   * bottom-up, not top-down (means emerging from low-level interaction)
   * life "as it is", and "as it might be"
  * "Artificial" is related to components, not to emergent processes
  * "Big" claim that proper primitives with human-like functions will support process, that will be "alive" in the same meaning as for natural organisms (WRONG INTENTION FROM MY POINT OF VIEW - if we repeat human, it will be just a human - and we already know how to repeat human)
  * Applications:agent-based modeling (consumer markets, traffic flow), robotics, artificial worlds
  * *Mind parts*
   * Visual cortex / Occipital lobe / Parietal lobe / Primary auditory cortex / Temporal lobe / Somatic sensory cortex
   * Frontal lobe / Vocalization / Vocalization region of motor area / Motor area (precentral gyrus) - leg, arm, face / Supplementary motor area
   * Central sulcus / Broca's area / Sylvian tissue / Wernicke's area / Angular gyrus / Arcuate fasciculus
  * Damage of Occipital lobe leads to inability to dream
  * Damage of Visual cortex leads to lack of depth perception and inability to assemble parts into whole

  * *Motor Cortex Map* (see Motor Cortex Homunculus):
   * Toes / Ankle / Knee / Hip / Trunk / Shoulder / Elbow / Wrist / Hand
   * Fingers: Little / Ring / Middle / Index / Thumb
   * Neck / Brow / Eyelid and eyeball / Face
   * Vocalization: Lips / Jaw / Tongue / Swallowing
  * ANNs capture key features of biological neural networks (connectionism) using:
   * Hebbian learning
   * Suitable wiring diagram
  * How to proceed
   * Genetic Algorithms (computational realm)
   * Natural Selection (biological realm)
   * Any little niche, survive, reproduce, adopt to changes
   * Provide suitably rich physics, adequate energy
   * Use biologically inspired models: rich genetic structure, ontogeny (process), environment, invoke evolution, wait
  * We are our bodies and it is a process, not substrate
  * Machine intelligence not equal to natural intelligence

=== 2. Is It Alive ===

  * Artificial Life is broader - whether biological science can help?
  * What is Life:
   * Neumann / information flow
   * Monod / form and function resulted from evolution not design, carried from one generation to another, derived from internal self-description
  * *Farmer & Belin's criteria*:
   * Pattern in spacetime (continuum property of organizational patterns)
   * Self-reproduction (not right for mule)
   * Information storage of a self-representation (DNA) (not right for prion)
   * Metabolism (converts matter and energy from the environment into the pattern and activities of the organism)
   * Functional interactions with the environment
   * Interdependence of parts (rock can be split, human will be killed) (not right for virus)
   * Stability under perturbations
   * The ability to evolve (existence if lineage) (not right for virus)
  * *Wet Artificial Life*
   * Man-made - plant breeding, animal husbandry, and pet domestication
   * Genetic engineering - more radical
   * Primordial soup
   * Test tube evolution (amplify desired evolution)
   * Minimal bacterial genome
   * Synthetic biology
  * *Self-Organization*
   * Increasing differentiation of parts
   * Increasing integration of these parts
   * Underlies the spontaneous formation of structure
   * Antagonist of entropy
  * *Evolution*
   * Darwinian - information is passed only via genetic information (biological)
   * Lamarckian - information learned during an organismâ€™s lifetime was also passed from one generation to the next
   * Genetic Engineering - allow Lamarckian evolution for biological organisms
   * Artificial Life - allow Lamarckian evolution for artificial organisms

=== 3. Introduction to Genetic Algorithms ===

  * IGNORE - AT FIRST LEVEL OF MODELING, EVOLUTION CANNOT AFFECT PERSONALITY

=== 4. Simulated Evolution ===

  * IGNORE - MODELING EVOLUTION IS APART FROM PERSONALITY

=== 5. Neural Networks - Definitions ===

  * NN - are:
   * systems to use HI organizational principles
   * elements operating in parallel
   * nodes function like nodes in natural neuron
   * distributed computation

Artificial Life research covers finding features and implementation approaches which create difference between living creature and machine, disregarding its intelligence.

=== Living Features ===

  * self-replication
  * self-assembly
  * self-organization
  * metabolism
  * adaptation
  * evolution

=== Complex Adaptive System Features ===

  * emergence (interaction in non-planned way)
  * co-evolution (with environment)
  * sub-optimality (trade off increased efficiency in favor of greater effectiveness)
  * requisite variety (strength from variety)
  * connectivity (relations more important than components)
  * simple rules (not complicated)
  * iteration (small changes can have significant effect)
  * self-organizing (no planning, hierarchy and control)
  * edge of chaos (dynamic enough to respond to environment)
  * nested systems

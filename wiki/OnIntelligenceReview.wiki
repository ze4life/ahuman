Below are most interesting thoughts, from my point of view, of really great book by Jeff Hawkins, well-known author of HTM theory and founder of Numenta company, which tries to build commercial products from theory of neocortex.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Chapter 1. Artificial Intelligence =

  * many people believe that AI is alive and just waiting for enough computing power; AI suffers from fundamental flaw of not addressing intelligence and understanding
  * AI can produce useful products but not intelligent machines
  * Turing's test for intelligence absolutely wrong - trying to produce human-like behaviour
  * Chinese Room argument - without understanding Chinese symbols you cannot understand Chinese language
  * *AI researchers do not attempt to understand brain*

= Chapter 2. Neural Networks =

  * neural networks are based on real nervous system
  * still, neural networks do not account: rapidly changing streams of information, importance of feedback (feedback connections are 10 times greater than feed-forward) and physical architecture of the brain (neocortex is not simple)
   * back-propagation is not like feedback as used only for supervised learning
  * *neural networks settled on over-simplified models* - connectionists
  * neural networks research stopped to evolve, declaring brain-like while being far from it
  * the same problem as in AI - focus on behaviour - correct or desired output
  * *behaviour is manifestation of intelligence but not primary definition of being intelligent*
  * major result - invention of auto-associative memory (Hopfield networks), having feedbacks and able to store delays on feedback connections; but these are ignored
  * neuroscientists create mind maps, trying to find where certain activity arises but not how
  * functionalists: function is important, not media; if replace brain with artificial neurons, it will do the same
  * *kludge* - programs, written without foresight
  * cognitive wheel - invented by human, not by nature; but intelligence is internal property of brain - so need to understand it, not emulating just behaviour

= Chapter 3. Human Brain =

  * *neocortex* - thin sheet of neural tissue enveloping older parts of brain
  * intelligence occurs in neocortex; other parts make human being
   * all essential aspects of intelligence occur in the neocortex, with important roles also played by thalamus and hippocampus
  * neocortex is 6 layers total of 2 mm thick
  * size of neocortex reflects *level of intelligence*
  * neocortex has very high density of neurons
   * 1mm x 1mm square area has 100K neurons; total 30G neurons in neurocortex
  * *neocortex is the same across all its surface*
  * neuroscientists thought neurocortex consists of functional areas
   * functional areas are the same for almost all people
  * *neocortex functional areas are arranged in branching hierarchy*
   * hierarchy is nothing related to physical locations but how regions are connected
   * lower areas feed information up to higher areas by way of a certain neural pattern of connectivity, while higher areas send feedback back to lower areas using a different connection pattern; there are also lateral connections between areas in separate branches
   * *lower functional areas are primary sensory areas* - where sensory information arrives in the neocortex, e.g. V1 (primary visual area) - which feeds to V2, V4 (objects of medium complexity), IT, MT (motion) and others; the same for other sensors - A1 (auditory), S1 (somatosensory)
  * *sensory information passes into association areas* - areas receiving information from several senses; their functions remain unclear
  * *areas in frontal lobe create motor output*; they are also hierarchically arranged
   * lowest area, M1, sends connections to the spinal cord and directly drives muscles
   * higher areas feed sophisticated motor commands to M1
  * *information flows both ways - from sensors to muscles and vice versa*
   * *much more information flows as a feedback than from senses*
  * neuron has body, axon and dendrites; axon connecting of one neuron to dendrite of another neuron, forms a connection - synapse
   * synapse can be excitatory or inhibitory
   * strength of synapse changes depending on behaviour of two neurons (Hebbian learning)
   * new synapses can be created
   * changes in synapses causes memories to be stored
  * 8 of 10 neurons are pyramidal cells
   * each sends lengthy axon laterally to distant areas, or down to lower brain structures like thalamus
   * each pyramidal cell has 1-10K synapses; it makes total of 30T synapses
  * top layer of neocortex is a lot of axons but few cells
  * *neocortex makes the same operation in all its areas*
   * differences arise from how areas are connected to each other and to other parts of central neural system
   * the same algorithm - for vision, hearing and so on
  * neocortex is dividing itself on functional areas long into childhood, based purely on experience
   * by experiments in newborn animal areas interchanged surgically
   * *no areas in neocortex are unused* even if some senses are not functioning (blind)
   * *genes define architecture of neocortex*, but within this structure mind is high flexible
  * cortical algorithm can be deployed in novel ways, with novel senses in machined cortical senses, outside of biological brains
  * *data from different senses are sent to the cortex in the same way as spatial and temporal patterns*
   * visual information sent via 100M-fiber cable, with transit though thalamus to V1
   * sound is carried via 30K-fiber cable through old mind areas to A1
   * spinal cord carries touch and internal sensations information via 1M-fiber cable to S1
   * it is important where patterns enter neocortex
  * vision relies on temporal patterns
   * 3 times per second eyes make sudden movement - saccade, then stop - fixation
   * pattern arriving to V1 is completely different with each saccade
   * time is a central component of a vision
  * sound has spacial patterns by means of different sequences activating different regions of cochlea bone; it changes in time - resulting in spatial-temporal patterns
  * ability to make complex use of touch depends on continuous time-varying patterns of touch sensation
  * *neocortex uses only patterns and extremely flexible*
   * it even does not know where body ends
   * it can quickly adopt to changes in the body
   * sensory substitution - if project camera image to sensing area, blind can see
  * *brain is pattern machine*
   * it does not depend on any specific sense to be intelligent
   * *brain perceives model of the world not the real world*
   * that's why no much difference from perception of written and spoken languages

= Chapter 4. Memory =

  * *external world patterns stream, via old brain, into neocortex*
  * *brain-as-computer analogy is wrong*
   * neurons are quite slow - 5ms per operation = 200 ops/sec
   * AI society says computer is unable to emulate mind because it is parallel
   * try 100-step rule - e.g. you can recognise image in less than second - in 100 steps; even parallel computers will not be able to do this in 100 steps
   * brain does not compute answer but extract it from memory
  * *neocortex is memory system, not a computer*
  * consider task of catching ball
   * human does this easily; almost impossible to teach robot arm to do this - it requires fast 3D vision, computing ball path and computing robot arm movement
   * brain uses memory of muscle commands: 1) memory recalled by sight of ball 2) recalls temporal sequence of muscle commands and 3) retrieved memory adjusted to accommodate the particulars of the moment - ball's actual path and body position
   * brain handles variances by using invariant representations in the neocortex, not by differential equations
  * *difference between neocortical memory and computer memory*
   * neocortex stores sequences of patterns
   * neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively
   * neocortex stores patterns in and invariant form
   * neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy
  * *sequence of patterns:*
   * impossible to think about anything complex if not series events or thoughts
   * one pattern evoke the next pattern
   * with a conscious effort we can jump, but then follow temporal sequence
   * memory recall follows pathway of associations
   * e.g. alphabet - sequence of patterns, hard to recall in reverse order
   * memory of tunes contain temporal sequences: if start from specific note, can play forward but not backward; cannot recall all the tune at once
   * all memories can be extracted with proper cues - even those that haven't thought for many years
   * only few neurons and synapses are active in the moment; one active set replaced with another set by sequences
  * *auto-associative recall:*
   * recall complete pattern when given only partial or distorted pattern
   * recall spatial items and temporal sequences - brain is not confused seeing part of object
   * during conversation we do not hear some words which we perceive
   * recall by middle or by end of sequence
   * if you think about smth and instantly see your friend - recall occurs - you are unavoidably switching to related sequences
   * random thoughts never occur - thought means chain of memories; non-deterministic
  * *invariant representations:*
   * brain remembers important relationships in the world independent from the details
   * AI auto-associative memories are failed when we move, rotate, scale picture, while it is not a problem for cortex
   * we perceive something as constant when patterns are novel (never seen) or changing
   * we use *invariant representation* to refer to internal brain representation
   * if show face in various positions - on some upper level activates the same neurons
   * it should be easy - we use it automatically and it is very fast - but it is one of the biggest problems for science and no power computer can solve it
   * Plato asked long ago - how we understand ideal circle or dog concepts?
   * you can create signature with hand or elbow - it will be different but you play the same abstract motor program - invariant representation in motor cortex - motor command
   * consider tune - you recognize tune as the same if started from different notes (transposed) - you can play known tune from some note even if you never heard it from this note; it means tune is stored by intervals not by absolute notes
   * in recognising faces we consider spatial intervals - size of eye compared to size of nosed; colour of hair compared to colour of eye
   * memory storing, recall and recognition occurs on level of invariant forms
  * *memory prediction occurs by combining current inputs and invariant representations*

= Chapter 5. A New Framework of Intelligence =

  * we can understand smth but without any actions
  * *what we perceive is a combination of sense and memory-derived predictions*
  * *altered door experiment*
   * smth in the door you open every day is changed (one of dozens parameters)
   * you will quickly detect that something is wrong
   * brain makes low-level sensory prediction about what is expected
   * sense neurons become active in advance of actual input
   * expectation violation will cause you to take notice
  * *correct prediction result in understanding*
  * *incorrect prediction result in confusion and prompt you to pay attention*
  * *prediction is primary function of the neocortex and the foundation of intelligence*
  * *behaviour is by-product of prediction*
  * examples - step on broken stair, music song in album; pleasant sensation of mild uncertainty when you listen album on random shuffle
  * prediction is not exact - our *mind makes probabilistic predictions* - please take me... "salt", "pepper" but not "sidewalk"
  * in music you never heard before - you have strong expectations (beats, rhythm...)
  * we see what we expect to see as often as we see what we really see - e.g. we see picture over blind spot in the eye - place where eye nerve goes; holes are in different locations but we do not see black hole even when we close one eye
  * consider saccade and person having extra nose instead of one eye
  * human brain is more intelligent because it can make predictions about more abstract kinds of patterns and longer temporal pattern sequences
  * you can predict smth (e.g. smbd who wants you to make smth)
   * you do not know how it will be exposed but you expect it
   * *higher intelligence is not a different kind of process from perceptual intelligence*
  * intelligence is measured by the capacity to remember and predict patterns
  * intelligent understanding and behaviour are completely separate
  * *neocortex appeared after animals already evolved sophisticated behaviour*
   * in the beginning neocortex served to efficiently use existing behaviour, not to create new behaviour
   * 100M years ago were animals with complex behaviour
   * difference between human and reptile - large cortex
   * human has old (primitive) brain - ancient structures in the brain - for blood pressure, hunger, sex, emotions and many aspects of moving
   * neocortex appeared 10M years ago, only mammals have it
   * only 2M years ago neocortex has expanded dramatically - relatively new structure
   * cortex not only remember sense data but behaviour produced by old mind
  * our motor and planning abilities vastly exceed those of of animals
   * neocortex generates sophisticated behaviour unique to humans
   * neocortex algorithm is so powerful that with little rewire it can create new, sophisticated behaviour
   * neocortex can make accurate sensory predictions only if it knows what behaviours are being performed
   * brain first moves the arm then predicts what it will see
  * our brains are connected differently
   * back part contains inputs where sense data arrive - eyes, ears...
   * front part contains high-level planning, thought, and motor cortex
  * most animals rely on older parts, human cortex usurped most of motor control
  * if you damage motor cortex - human becomes paralysed
  * dolphins have big neocortex but not so connected to motor areas
  * *intelligence started as memory system added prediction*
  * neocortex evolved in size and it started to interact with motor system of the old brain
  * all this is *memory-prediction framework*
  * Alan Turing was wrong: *prediction, not behaviour, is the proof of intelligence*

= Chapter 6. How The Cortex Works =

  * brain theory is like solving giant puzzle - because of many low-level facts; theory is incomplete - some facts are not understood yet
  * *top-down approach* - find how cortex can memorise and and store sequences, make predictions, form invariant representations, create and store model of world, independent of changing circumstances

== Invariant representations ==

  * visual regions, involved in recognition of object - V1, V2, V4, IT
   * V1 has input of 1M axons from optical nerve
  * cortex is a big sheet of tissue containing functional areas
   * regions are connected by large bundles of axons, transferring information all in once
   * collective activity of bundle is named *pattern*
  * saccades create too different images because of fovea and jerking shifts; still you do not aware about these changes
  * V1 area neurons have *receptive fields*
   * each neuron knows about pinsize portion of visual space; but nothing about faces, cars and so on
   * each neuron is tuned for specific form of patterns - e.g. line or edge
   * from one fixation neurons will fire strongly, from others - weakly or not at all
  * in IT we find cells that become and stay active when objects is appearing on visual field, e.g. face
   * IT cell's receptive field covers most of visual space and fires from faces
   * in 4 areas cells changing from rapidly changing, spatially specific tiny feature recognition cells to constantly firing, spatially non-specific, object-recognition cells - invariant representation of faces
   * no computer still solved this problem with robustness and generality
   * bundles of feedback axons, more than feed-forward, go from higher regions like IT to V2, V4, V1
   * prediction requires comparison between expectation and actual input
  * in real human mind regions are interconnected in all sorts of ways
   * *majority of human cortex consists of association area*
  * we see the same feedback, prediction and invariant recall in auditory cortex
   * we cannot recognise object in one pattern of input, not like vision
   * neural activity for objects must last longer than individual input patterns
   * pattern coming from your ear or touch sensors does not contain sufficient information at any one point of time what you are hearing or feeling
  * the higher up in the cortex you go, the fewer changes over time you should see
   * in vision we have also ability to recognize spatial patterns; but normal vision requires constant eye movement

== Integrating the senses ==

  * you can have visual sensor data expectations emerged from auditory signal
   * information flows up auditory hierarchy to association area connecting vision and hearing
   * representation then flows back down visual and auditory hierarchies, causing both visual and auditory predictions
   * this kind of multi-sensory prediction occurs all the time
  * information simultaneously flows up and down sensory hierarchies to create unified sensory experience involving prediction n all senses
   * entire neocortex, all sensory and association areas, acts as one
  * all predictions are learned by experience
   * if there are consistent patterns among inputs, cortex will use them to predict future events
  * motor cortex behaves in almost the same way as sensory region
  * input to sensory area can flow to association area, which can lead to a pattern flowing down the motor cortex, resulting in behaviour
   * in sensory cortex we say predictions, in motor we say commands
   * no pure sensory or motor area (V2 visual area controls eye muscles)

== A new view of V1 ==

  * higher regions of cortical hierarchy form invariant representations
   * why only at the top? - cortex is the same everywhere
   * there are V1, V2, V4, IT regions - every is regarded is continuous, covering all visual area, IT at the top
  * classical view - V1 extracts low-level primitives, then V2, V4 and invariance created only in IT
   * why IT so special?
  * consider you see face in one corner of V1 or, next time, in another corner
   * these parts are distant and are not connected, still do similar action
   * all high regions receive inputs from many other regions, while V1 is connected only to V2 - why it is different?
  * solution: V1, V2, V4 should be viewed as collections of many smaller regions
   * V1 is made up of numerous separate little areas, connected to neighbours only indirectly via higher regions
   * IT is single region having birds-eye view of entire visual world
   * every region has a converged set of input regions  and sends projections back as predictions
   * each V1 region can be regarded as separate sensory stream
   * V2 and V4 are visual association areas
  * every region forms invariant representations = with only part of world and basic vocabulary, but do the same job as IT

== A model of the world ==

  * all objects are composed of subobjects that occur consistently together
   * we assign a name to set of features that consistently travel together
  * design of cortex and its learning method discover hierarchical relationships in the world
   * higher regions of cortex are maintaining representation of high-level structures while lower regions are maintaining representations of more detailed objects
   * hierarchy allows to know that you listen to song and album of music in the same time
   * higher regions are tracking big picture while lower levels are actively dealing with fast-changing, small details
  * we can see, hear, touch only tiny part of the world in one moment, so information flows as sequence of patterns
  * sequence is set of patterns that generally accompany together, but not always in a fixed order
   * components of face are can look at are checked in different order
  * real-time world objects can be abstract - e.g. word or theory
   * brain treats physical or abstract objects in the same way
  * predictability is definition of reality - predictable sequence of patterns must be part of larger object that really exists
   * regions assign names to predictable sequences and pass names to higher regions

== Sequences of sequences ==

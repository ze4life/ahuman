#summary Insights from Jeff Hawkins book - On Intelligence

----

= Chapter 1. Artificial Intelligence =

  * many people believe that AI is alive and just waiting for enough computing power; AI suffers from fundamental flaw of not addressing intelligence and understanding
  * AI can produce useful products but not intelligent machines
  * Turing's test for intelligence absolutely wrong - trying to produce human-like behaviour
  * Chinese Room argument - without understanding Chinese symbols you cannot understand Chinese language
  * AI researchers do not attempt to understand brain

= Chapter 2. Neural Networks =

  * neural networks are based on real nervous system
  * still, neural networks do not account: rapidly changing streams of information, importance of feedback (feedback connections are 10 times greater than feed-forward) and physical architecture of the brain (neocortex is not simple)
   * back-propagation is not like feedback as used only for supervised learning
  * neural networks settled on ultra-simple models - connectionists
  * neural networks research stopped to evolve, declaring brain-like while being far from it
  * the same problem as in AI - focus on behaviour - correct or desired output
  * behaviour is manifestation of intelligence but not primary definition of being intelligent
  * major result - invention of auto-associative memory (Hopfield networks), having feedbacks and able to store delays on feedback connections; but these are ignored
  * neuroscientists create mind maps, trying to find where certain activity arises but not how
  * functionalists: function is important, not media; if replace brain with artificial neurons, it will do the same
  * kludge - programs, written without foresight
  * cognitive wheel - invented by human, not by nature; but intelligence is internal property of brain - so need to understand it, not emulating just behaviour

= Chapter 3. Human Brain =

  * neocortex - thin sheet of neural tissue enveloping older parts of brain
  * intelligence occurs in neocortex; other parts make human being
   * all essential aspects of intelligence occur in the neocortex, with important roles also played by thalamus and hippocampus
  * neocortex is six layers total of 2 mm thick
  * size of neocortex reflects level of intelligence
  * neocortex has very high density of neurons
   * 1mm x 1mm square area has 100K neurons; total 30G neurons in neurocortex
  * neocortex is the same across all its surface
  * neuroscientists thought neurocortex consists of functional areas
   * functional areas are the same for almost all people
  * neocortex functional areas are arranged in branching hierarchy
   * hierarchy is nothing related to physical locations but how regions are connected
   * lower areas feed information up to higher areas by way of a certain neural pattern of connectivity, while higher areas send feedback back to lower areas using a different connection pattern; there are also lateral connections between areas in separate branches
   * lower functional areas are primary sensory areas - where sensory information arrives in the neocortex, e.g. V1 (primary visual area) - which feeds to V2, V4 (objects of medium complexity), IT, MT (motion) and others; the same for other sensors - A1 (auditory), S1 (somatosensory)
  * sensory information passes into association areas - areas receiving information from several senses; their functions remain unclear
  * areas in frontal lobe create motor output; they are also hierarchically arranged
   * lowest area, M1, sends connections to the spinal cord and directly drives muscles
   * higher areas feed sophisticated motor commands to M1
  * information flows both ways - from sensors to muscles and vice versa
   * much more information flows as a feedback than from senses
  * neuron has body, axon and dendrites; axon connecting of one neuron to dendrite of another neuron, forms a connection - synapse
   * synapse can be excitatory or inhibitory
   * strength of synapse changes depending on behaviour of two neurons (Hebbian learning)
   * new synapses can be created
   * changes in synapses causes memories to be stored
  * 8 of 10 neurons are pyramidal cells
   * each sends lengthy axon laterally to distant areas, or down to lower brain structures like thalamus
   * each pyramidal cell has 1-10K synapses; it makes total of 30T synapses
  * top layer of neocortex is a lot of axons but few cells
  * neocortex makes the same operation in all its areas
   * differences arise from how areas are connected to each other and to other parts of central neural system
   * the same algorithm - for vision, hearing and so on
  * neocortex is dividing itself on functional areas long into childhood, based purely on experience
   * by experiments in newborn animal areas interchanged surgically
   * no areas in neocortex are unused even if some senses are not functioning (blind)
   * genes define architecture of neocortex, but within this structure mind is high flexible
  * cortical algorithm can be deployed in novel ways, with novel senses in machined cortical senses, outside of biological brains
  * data from different senses are sent to the cortex in the same way as spatial and temporal patterns
   * visual information sent via 100M-fiber cable, with transit though thalamus to V1
   * sound is carried via 30K-fiber cable through old mind areas to A1
   * spinal cord carries touch and internal sensations information via 1M-fiber cable to S1
  * vision relies on temporal patterns
   * 3 times per second eyes make sudden movement - saccade, then stop - fixation

   * it is important where patterns enter neocortex

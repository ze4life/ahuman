#summary Insights from Jeff Hawkins book - On Intelligence

----

= Chapter 1. Artificial Intelligence =

  * many people believe that AI is alive and just waiting for enough computing power; AI suffers from fundamental flaw of not addressing intelligence and understanding
  * AI can produce useful products but not intelligent machines
  * Turing's test for intelligence absolutely wrong - trying to produce humanlike behavior
  * Chinese Room argument - without understanding Chinese symbols you cannot understand Chinese language
  * AI researchers do not attempt to understand brain

= Chapter 2. Neural Networks =

  * neural networks are based on real nervous system
  * still, neural networks do not account: rapidly changing streams of information, importance of feedback (feedback connections are 10 times greater than feed-forward) and physical architecture of the brain (neocortex is not simple)
   * back-propagation is not like feedback as used only for supervised learning
  * neural networks settled on ultrasimple models - connectionists
  * neural networks research stopped to evolve, declaring brainlike while being far from it
  * the same problem as in AI - focus on behavior - correct or desired output
  * behavior is manifestation of intelligence but not primary definition of being intelligent
  * major result - invention of autoassociative memory (Hopfield networks), having feedbacks and able to store delays on feedback connections; but these are ignored
  * neuroscientists create mind maps, trying to find where certain activity arises but not how
  * functionalists: function is important, not media; if replace brain with artificial neurons, it will do the same
  * kludge - programs, written without foresight
  * cognitive wheel - invented by human, not by nature; but intelligence is internal property of brain - so need to understand it, not emulating just behavior

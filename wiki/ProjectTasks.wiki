= Development Goals =

*Project Planning:*

  * see [ProjectPlanning]

*Tactical Goals:*

  * start artificial research with creating set of aHuman components
  * create aHuman objects in code using defined by artificial research
  * automated tracking of bio research and artificial research

= Book of Work =

== Build biological human model ==

  * make sure all spinal nerves attached to roots (needs validator)
  * add sympathetic/parasympathetic nerves to roots
  * make target region link type names consistent
  * add mind connections to cover PNS
  * add reference as covered by PNS
  * add links to external and internal muscle reference at target pages

= Book of Done =

== Build biological human model ==

  * make sure set of muscles and glands match target connectors (needs validator)
  * make nervelist entries resolved, define connectors (needs validator)
  * add mind connections to target pages
  * split mindcover into dura sensor (meninges) and blood vessels effector
  * make sure all muscles and glands are innervated (needs validator)
  * make sure all nerves are connected to muscles and glands (needs validator)
  * group connectors within target
  * split mouth effector into speaker and feeder, move breath functions to lung
  * replace glands defined as mind components with target connectors

= Development Goals =

*Project Planning:*

  * see [ProjectPlanning]

*Tactical Goals:*

  * create consistent and full biological human model
  * automated tracking of bio research and artificial research
  * define aHuman services with flexible and transparent workflow

= Book of Work =

== Build biological human model ==

  * make sure all spinal nerves attached to roots (needs validator)
  * make target region link type names consistent
  * add reference as covered by PNS
  * build formal spinal cord model
   * consider every level separately
   * ensure each nerve reaches its connectivity
   * ensure input/output component coverage
  * describe all tracts paths
  * split mind areas into observable local circuits
  * add service set to area page
  * create cranial mind page
  * create subcortical mind page
  * use tract information in spinal cord, cranial, cortical and subcortical  pages

== Improve mind engine ==

  * [ProjectTasksLifecycle modify aHuman lifecycle]

= Book of Done =

== Build biological human model ==

  * make sure set of muscles and glands match target connectors (needs validator)
  * make nervelist entries resolved, define connectors (needs validator)
  * add mind connections to target pages
  * split mindcover into dura sensor (meninges) and blood vessels effector
  * make sure all muscles and glands are innervated (needs validator)
  * make sure all nerves are connected to muscles and glands (needs validator)
  * group connectors within target
  * split mouth effector into speaker and feeder, move breath functions to lung
  * replace glands defined as mind components with target connectors
  * add links to external and internal muscle reference at target pages
  * split hmind into parts
  * add sympathetic/parasympathetic nerves to roots
  * add mind connections to cover PNS
  * generate tracts overview and tract set pages in wiki
  * build formal spinal cord model
   * generate spinal cord page
   * generate spinal cord levels section
   * generate spinal cord tracts section
   * generate spinal cord connectivity section

== Improve mind engine ==

  * add support for local circuits

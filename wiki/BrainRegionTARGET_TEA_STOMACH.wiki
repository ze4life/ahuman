*Component items*:
  * *Outer longitudinal and inner circular smooth muscles (stomach-wall)*: acetylcholine activates muscarinic receptors on smooth muscles - increasing motility of the stomach
  * *Stomach mucosal gastric glands (stomach-mucosal-gastric-glands)*: acetylcholine activates muscarinic receptors cause an increase in gastric juice secretion
  * *Stomach (stomach)*: secretes protein-digesting enzymes called proteases and strong acids to aid in food digestion; digestion; nutrition sensor; some absorption
  * *Duodentum (duodentum)*: food intake regulation, via glucoreception in taste receptors
  * *Small intestine (small-intestine)*: where most chemical digestion takes place; food from stomach is allowed into duodenum through pylorus by pyloric sphincter; absorb nutrients from ingested food
  * *Colon (colon)*: extracts water and salt from solid wastes; storing waste
  * *Pancreas (pancreas)*: secret digestive enzymes that act in small intestine
  * *Spleen (spleen)*: red pulp - blood filter, removes old red blood cells, holds a reserve of blood, recycles iron; white pulp - synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation
  * *Kidney (kidney)*: regulating acid-base balance, electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, blood pressure, filter to urine

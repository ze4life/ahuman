== Overview ==

Project framework is based on Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition - free IDE. Subversion is used as a version control system.

== How To Setup Development Environment ==

Finish [JoinProject Joining the Project] quest before trying below

  * [VisualStudio2010 Setup Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition]
  * [Subversion Setup Subversion]
  * [Sources Download Sources and Build]
  * [LocalIDEEnvironment Run and Debug Locally]

== Project Structure Guidelines ==

  * Projects are not directly dependent on each other; if dependencies exist, related interfaces and binaries are copied into target project codebase
  * Virtual folders should correspond to directories, except for below cases
   * if folder contains files of different types - e.g. headers and C++, then we can create virtual folders to separate these types - e.g. "include" directory
   * if folder has too many files to manage - we can split files by folders (but better to split files by subdirectories as well)
  * Any project contains typical directories on top level:
   * src - all sources, including C/C++ headers and body files
   * bin - output files should be redirected to this location
   * build - intermediate files, byproducts of build
   * etc - configuration files if any
   * lib - used libraries
  * any project is included in one or more workspaces
   * project corresponds to the build target
   * workspace corresponds to the deployment target and has name:
{{{
"workspace.<deployment target name>"
}}}

== Upgrading the Development Environment ==

General IDE requirements:

  * Language is not P-code like Java - these programs work in sandbox and use quite heavy runtime
  * IDE is free
  * Evidence of successful discussion at forum

== Usign External Libraries ==

  * for each research area support several libraries implementing related features
  * each external library should have been committed as is, with all sources
  * customized library should have been specifically marked in the codebase
  * any external library should have wrapper code, functioning as a facade (limiting library scope to only used one and conforming interfaces to aHuman codestyle and design giudelines)

== Decommissioned child pages ==

  * [MSVC6 Setup Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0] - stale due to migration to Codelite
  * [Codelite Setup Codelite] - less convenient than Visual Studio

== Overview ==

Project framework is based on MSDEV - Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
Subversion is used as version control system.

== How To Setup Development Environment ==

Finish [JoinProject Joining the Project] quest before trying below

  * [Subversion Setup Subversion]
  * [MSVC6 Setup Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0] - stale due migration to Codelite
  * [Sources Download Sources and Build]
  * [LocalEnvironment Run Locally]

== Project Structure Guidelines ==

  * Projects are not directly dependent on each other; if dependencies exist, related interfaces and binaries are copied into target project codebase
  * Virtual folders should correspond to directories, except for below cases
  ** if folder contains files of different types - e.g. headers and C++, then we can create virtual folders to separate these types - e.g. "include" directory
  ** if folder has too many files to manage - we can split files by folders (but better to split files by subdirectories as well)
  * Any project contains typical directories on top level:
  ** src - all sources, including C/C++ headers and body files
  ** bin - output files should be redirected to this location
  ** build - intermediate files, byproducts of build
  ** etc - configuration files if any
  ** lib - used libraries
  * any project is included in one or more workspaces
  ** project corresponds to the build target
  ** workspace corresponds to the deployment target and has name:
{{{
"workspace.<deployment target name>"
}}}

Guys, thank you for your ideas.

== Upgrading the Development Environment ==

Well, described framework is quite ancient approach. In the same time old C++ guys know that 6.0 is quite successful implementation of development framework. When speaking about upgrades to more modern framework, I don't have objections, if you will manage transformation and providing further conditions are met:

  * Language is not P-code like Java - these programs work in sandbox and use quite heavy runtime
  * IDE is free (I know MSVC 6.0 was licensed)
  * Evidence of successful discussion at forum

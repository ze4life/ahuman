Guys, thank you for your ideas.

== Upgrading the Development Environment ==

Well, described framework is quite ancient approach. In the same time old C++ guys know that 6.0 is quite successful implementation of development framework. When speaking about upgrades to more modern framework, I don't have objections, if you will manage transformation and providing further conditions are met:

  * Language is not P-code like Java - these programs work in sandbox and use quite heavy runtime
  * IDE is free (I know MSVC 6.0 was licensed)
  * Evidence of successful discussion at forum

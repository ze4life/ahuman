#summary Converting specific external stream to neural stream

----

== Capture events ==

Certain:
  * conscious capture is performed by event
  * event is either control change command or spotted changes in external properties
  * conscious capture depends on capture resolution and capture area

Uncertain:
  * sensor has unconscious ongoing capture with constant low resolution but wide area
  * sensor can generate either full set of properties or only delta to previous transfer

== External stream ==

Certain:
  * one external stream item is transformed into zero, one or more sensor stream item
  * external item can be ignored if sensor stream is not consumed in time

Uncertain:
  * set of events produce external stream

== Sensor stream ==

Certain:
  * sensor stream has neural representation
  * sensor stream item is represented by vector of variables
  * each vector variable corresponds to specific sensor neuron
  * sensor neuron can have multiple connections to neocortex networks
  * external stream item is represented by sequence of vectors
  * sequence can be of different length depending on focus
  * one variable represents the same external properties for the same resolution

Uncertain:
  * sensor stream is stateless - every sensor item is derived only from one external item
  * vector variable is float
  * vector has the same number of variables for all sensor stream items
  * each variable does not have fixed semantics 
  * one variable can represent different external properties for different resolutions
 
== Finally for the project purposes ==

  * conscious capture by event
  * full property set transfer
  * throtteling of externall stream
  * external stream item if represented by sequence

#summary Converting specific external stream to neural stream

@@[Home] -> [SensorsResearch] -> [SensorsDigital2NeuralTransformation]
----

== Capture events ==

Certain:
  * conscious capture is performed by event
  * event is either control change command or spotted changes in external properties
  * conscious capture depends on capture resolution and capture area

Uncertain:
  * sensor has unconscious ongoing capture with constant low resolution but wide area
  * sensor can generate either full set of properties or only delta to previous transfer

== External stream ==

Certain:
  * set of events produce external stream
  * one external stream item is transformed into zero, one or more sensor stream item
  * sensor stream has neural representation - item is represented by vector of floats
  * external item can be ignored if sensor stream is not consumed in time

Uncertain:
  * sensor stream is stateless - every sensor item is derived only from one external item

Finally for the project purposes:
  * conscious capture by event
  * full property set transfer
  * throtteling of externall stream
  * external stream item if represented by sequence

Neocortex research covers activities to create functional and architectural requirements for building block of aHuman kernel - cortex, which is responsible for implementing intelligence and conscious behaviour in aHuman.
HTM/Memory Prediction theory is selected as baseline approach to implement Cortex element.
On project level Cortex is regarded as synonym to region of Neocortex from HTM theory.

Generic approach to research seems to be below one:

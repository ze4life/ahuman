----

Neocortex research covers activities to create functional and architectural requirements for building block of aHuman kernel - cortex, which is responsible for implementing intelligence and conscious behaviour in aHuman.

Research is required because neither Numenta (closed implementation, AI, not AL goals) nor open source cortex libraries (very simple, wrong direction) do not fit needs for aHuman project.

HTM/Memory Prediction theory is selected as baseline approach to implement Cortex element.
On project level Cortex is regarded as synonym to region of Neocortex from HTM theory.

Generic approach to research seems to be below one:

== Terms ==

*World-wide terms*

  * *cerebral cortex* = neocortex (6 layers) + some old brain structures (nuclia-based), e.g. hippocampus and olfactory cortex
  * *covert attention* - neocortex can both think about and perceive only a few different things simultaneously
  * *overt attention* - physically orienting toward some targets

*Project-level terms*

  * *cortex* - synonym to region of Neocortex from HTM theory

*Numbers*
  * neocortex has 10 times more feedback connections than feed forward ones
  * one neuron has max speed of 10ms
  * can recognise picture in 1 second hence having no more than 100-hop sequences
  * neocortex has exactly 6 layers
  * neocortex is 2mm thick and covers both hemispheres of human's head
  * neocortex area is 0.2 m2
  * neocortex has 2-5 million neocortical columns  
  * neocortex has 300-500M micro-columns
  * neocortical column has ~50K neurons
  * neocortical columns are patches of neocortex with a diameter of about 0.5 mm and a depth of 2 mm
  * HI has 25 connections per neuron in average
  * HI operates at around 10^15 computations per seconds
  * neural density is 100K n/mm3
  * optical nerve has 1M axons
  * auditory nerve has 30K axons
  * human DNA has 20-25K genes
  * between regions, in myelin insolation, signal is spreading via axon with 200 miles/hour = 9 cm/ms
  * synapses relating to vision peak at ~10 months, density of synapses then declines and stabilises ~10 years of age
  * neocortex contains two primary types of neurons, ~80% excitatory pyramidal neurons, and ~20% inhibitory interneurons

*Functions*
  * unsupervised learning of abstraction hierarchies for representing the structure in the world
  * learning invariant representations
  * covers both sensors and effectors
  * uses the same algorithm with local adjustments
  * learns - to predict the future, filter unnecessary information away, generalise
  * forms associations
  * cat can live without cortex, human cannot - cortex has too much responsibility for muscles
  * cortex implements selective attention
  * cortex has long-term (episodic) memory along hippocampus
  * cortex learns about rewarding features, on par with basal ganglia
  * teaching signals are contextual inputs from the thalamus matrix cells and the neuromodulators
  * extra plasticity in critical period
  * global neuromodulation signals mediate information about rewards and punishments

*Overall neocortex use cases*

  * perception with/without training
  * expected/unexpected perception
  * conscious/unconscious perception
  * default/focused perception
  * remember episodic memory
  * direct/associative recall of episodic memory
  * sensor/motor action selection
  * sensor control in perception/motor control in execution
  * emotional perception/execution modulation
  * emotional dreaming
  * imagination

----

Neocortex research covers activities to create functional and architectural requirements for building block of aHuman kernel - cortex, which is responsible for implementing intelligence and conscious behaviour in aHuman.

Research is required because neither Numenta (closed implementation, AI, not AL goals) nor open source cortex libraries (very simple, wrong direction) do not fit needs for aHuman project.

HTM/Memory Prediction theory is selected as baseline approach to implement Cortex element.
On project level Cortex is regarded as synonym to region of Neocortex from HTM theory.

Generic approach to research seems to be below one:

== Terms ==

*World-wide terms*

  * *cerebral cortex* = neocortex (6 layers) + some old brain structures (nuclia-based), e.g. hippocampus and olfactory cortex
  * *covert attention* - neocortex can both think about and perceive only a few different things simultaneously
  * *overt attention* - physically orienting toward some targets

*Project-level terms*

  * *cortex* - synonym to region of Neocortex from HTM theory

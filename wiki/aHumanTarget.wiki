Full biological high-level model with all nucleus, cortices and related circuits

= Overview =

*Functions:*

  * target verifies mind model from several perspectives
  * target analyzes mind model, calculating derived properties
  * target by command plays specified flow scenario
  * target by command generates wiki pages

*Design:*

  * target executes commands from its topic
  * specific components for all sensory and effectors, not patterned in mind engine
  * target itself does not contain sensors or effectors
  * all regions are stubs and produce stub messages
  * all neurolinks are stubs and affect regions as a whole, not individual neurons

= Mind Model Verification =

*Inputs:*

  * mind.xml with linear list of components grouped by areas, and type definitions
  * hmind.xml with full mind hiearchy, containing:
   * components to be used in mind model and referenced in mind.xml
   * component aggregations
   * component elements

*Mapping rules:*

  * each component is presented in mind element hierarchy
  * each leaf hierarchy element is either component or part of component

*Local connectivity rules:*

  * each component connector is connected by links to other components
  * there are several inputs or several outputs
  * all component connectors are in use
  * sensory and motor components are defined

*Global connectivity rules:*

  * for every sensor output connector there is excitatory path to at least some one motor input
  * for every sensor output connector there is excitatory path to at least some input of the same sensor
  * for every motor output connector there is excitatory path to at least some input of the same motor
  * every component input has path to some sensor or motor output
  * every component output has path to some sensor or motor input

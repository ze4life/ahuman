== Mocked Functions ==

  * M-01. *aMatter* has *<font color="green">primitive predefined set of effectors</font>* producing representation in external world based on *<font color="green">predefined set of low-level commands</font>* provided by hardcoded motor strategies
  * M-02. *aMatter* limits effectors actions to ones *<font color="green">explaining internal representations</font>* in terms of *<font color="green">hardcoded symbolic language</font>*
  * M-03. *aMatter* has *<font color="green">primitive predefined hierarchy of behavioural strategies</font>*, on leaf level directly connected with effectors commands

== Cognition ==

  * C-01. *aMatter* receives information using *<font color="green">predefined set of sensors</font>*
  * C-02. *aMatter* *<font color="green">recognises</font>* received information in real-time mode and calculates recognition *<font color="green">metric R</font>* reflecting percentage of successfully recognised sensors inputs in given environment
  * C-03. *aMatter* *<font color="green">generalises</font>* unrecognised inputs so that R monotonously increases for the same static environment
  * C-04. *aMatter* forms growing set of internal entities, so that specific subset of *<font color="green">internal entities</font>*, when being in active state, can be treated as a representation of specific external data from sensors, disregarding whether previously perceived or internally inspired
  * C-05. *aMatter* is able to *<font color="green">forget</font>* internal entities, if not activated for a long time, so that the same input *<font color="green">triggers</font>* another set of internal entities after a while
  * C-06. *aMatter* forms growing set of *<font color="green">associations</font>* between internal entities activated about the same time

== Feeling ==

  * F-01. *aMatter* collects information from *<font color="green">predefined set of embodiment signals</font>* equivalent in purpose with human being, with body treated as related operating system process with all its inherent features and properties
  * F-02. *aMatter* collects *<font color="green">predefined set of uncertainty metrics</font>* from expectation flow of behavioural strategies

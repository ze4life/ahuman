  * *aMatter* receives information using *<font color="green">predefined set of sensors</font>*
  * *aMatter* *<font color="green">recognises</font>* received information in real-time mode and calculates recognition *<font color="green">metric R</font>* reflecting percentage of successfully recognised sensors inputs in given environment
  * *aMatter* *<font color="green">generalises</font>* unrecognised inputs so that R monotonously increases for the same static environment
  * *aMatter* forms growing set of internal entities, so that specific subset of *<font color="green">internal entities</font>*, when being in active state, can be treated as a representation of specific external data from sensors, disregarding whether previously perceived or internally inspired
  * *aMatter* is able to *<font color="green">forget</font>* internal entities, if not activated for a long time, so that the same input *<font color="green">triggers</font>* another set of internal entities after a while
  * *aMatter* forms growing set of *<font color="green">associations</font>* between internal entities activated about the same time
  * *aMatter* collects information from *<font color="green">predefined set of embodiment signalss</font>* equivalent in purpose with human being

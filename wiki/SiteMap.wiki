----

This page is intended to explain aHuman project page set to let you known where what can be found. Also it is a tool to ensure that pages are not trying to duplicate each other and cover project area in a reasonable way.

= Home Page =

  * Google Project Home is [http://code.google.com/p/ahuman/] leading to site home page [Home]
  * goals and generic approach for the project are explained on [ProjectVision]
  * approaches to allow many people to research and create aHuman program across internet are listed by topic in Tools and Procedures section
  * high-level division of aHuman research area into sub-areas can be found in the middle column named Research
  * finally, Development column describes important activities regarding creation of the program - technical design, coding and testing

= Tools and Procedures =

  * [JoinProject] explains how to become a project member
  * [ProjectCommunications] lists used techniques to communicate across team
  * [DevelopmentEnvironment] helps to establish development environment and do the coding
  * [CodeStyleGuide] and [DesignStyleGuide] establish some limitations on coding and design
  * [ResearchCycle] and [DevelopmentCycle] present procedules to participate in specific research and development respectively
  * [ProjectTeam] - is a page where each project member can present himself

= Research =

  * [BiologicalLifeResearch] - High-level components and curcuits of human biology. One of severe aHuman project principles is to make use of biological architecture where possible
  * [ArtificialLifeResearch] - Concepts of creating personality and feeling by means of software program
  * [ArtificialIntelligenceResearch] - Approaches of creating intelligent behaviour
  * [NeuralNetworksResearch] - creating Neural Networks engine, which will be able to represent any required neural network with appropriate structure and characteristics
  * [NeoCortexResearch] - create model of neocortex, which is the foundation of intelligence as per current neurobiogy data
  * [SensorsResearch] - modeling generalised sensors as foundation for any specific target sensor element
  * [MotorResearch] - modeling generalised effectors and related proprioceptors as foundation for any specific target motor element
  * [ArtificialIntelligenceDictionary] - attempt to collect various terms to point to areas of further understanding and possible use
  * [Library] - list of printed books, which can play significant role on understanding the project. It does not mention numerous articles, which are stored in [http://code.google.com/p/ahuman/source/browse/#svn%2Fresearch%2Farticles svn subtree]

= Development =

  * [ProjectPlanning] - project implementation plan
  * [Architecture] - components and curcuits of aHuman
  * [Specs] - component-level design information
  * [TestFramework] - test and debugging techiniques and tools
  * [Creatures] - considered aHuman targets
  * [Features] - valued features implemented by aHuman components
  * [ExternalKnowledgeBase] - third-party code used
  * [RelatedResearchProjects] - collection of external projects in aHuman project area

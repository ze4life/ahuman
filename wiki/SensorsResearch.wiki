Sensors research covers creating sensors suitable for artificial life, able to capture and transfer externally originated information in realtime using limited resources, as well as clarifying nature of sensor inputs, outputs and sensor auto-adoption to aHuman intentions and environment conditions.

== Terms ==

  * *sensor* - capture and passive feedback element
  * *external world property* - property of external world captured by sensor
  * *capture area* - part of external world, perceived by sensor
  * *capture resolution* - set of external world properties, captured by sensor
  * *sensor control state* - sensor state, defining current capture area and current capture resolution
  * *exposed sensor property* - aHuman property available to external world, generated by sensor control state

== Research targets ==

  * [SensorsRoleAndFunctions Define role and functions of sensor]
  * Understand cooperation of mupliple sensors
  * Produce computational model of sensor, suitable for various sensor types
  * Understand the nature of sensor focus control
  * Propose set of sensors for specific aHuman targets

NeuroStream research covers dynamics of transmitting neural signals via !NeuroLink based on properties of natural human neurotransmitters and effects of reverberation.

== Features == 

  * NeuroLink is bundle of fibers
  * NeuroLink connects one set of neurons to another set of neurons
  * NeuroLink source neurons are from the same region
  * NeuroLink destination neurons are from the same region
  * source region and destination region can be the same or different
  * NeuroLink is unidirectional
  * NeuroLink is using the same neurotransmitter for all fibers
  * neurotransmitter defines characteristics of transmission:
   * transmission speed
   * receptor thresholds
   * affecting apical or distal dendrites
  * one event - one transmission across all fibers
  * both NeuroLink ends are connected to source or destination region topologically - as defined by nature of region

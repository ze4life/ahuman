NeuroStream research covers dynamics of transmitting neural signals via !NeuroLink based on properties of natural human neurotransmitters and effects of reverberation.

== Features == 

  * NeuroLink is bundle of fibers
   * each fiber corresponds to part of axon starting after initial axon segment (which can be modulated by connection) and includes all axon endings, while dendrites with its receptors are part of NeuroPool (set of neurons)
   * one fiber is connected to the only source neuron
   * one fiber is connected to the set of destination neurons topologically close to each other (receptive field)
  * NeuroLink connects one NeuroPool to another NeuroPool
   * source NeuroPool and destination NeuroPool can be of the same of different NeuroRegion
   * signal flows across NeuroLink in one direction
  * NeuroLink is using the same neurotransmitter for all fibers
  * neurotransmitter defines characteristics of transmission:
   * transmission speed
   * affected receptors
   * how long is activation in time
  * one event - one transmission across all fibers
   * activation blocks fired axon branch for a certain time
  * both NeuroLink ends are connected to source or destination region topologically - according to its geometry defined by design of region
  * each fiber on destination has certain receptive field, resulting from branching of corresponding axon

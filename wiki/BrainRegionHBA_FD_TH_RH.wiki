Region is part of aHuman target integrated biological model.

  * *Top-down path to region*: Forebrain Diencephalon -> Thalamus (FD.TH) -> Midline Nuclear Group of Thalamus (FD.TH.MTH) -> Rhomboidal Nucleus of Thalamus (HBA.FD.TH.RH)(see [OverallMindMaps Mind Maps])
  * *Brain area*: [BrainAreaHBA Hippocampus Basal Area]
  * *function*: Communication of information across memory delays to guide memory responses
  * *Notes to function*: like RE, return projection from PFC to HC, spatial working memory

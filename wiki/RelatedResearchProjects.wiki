  * [http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/ Blue Brain Project] - the first comprehensive attempt to reverse-engineer the mammalian brain, in order to understand brain function and dysfunction through detailed simulations
{{{
Computer simulations in neuroscience hold the promise of dramatically enhancing the
scientific method by providing a means to test hypotheses using predictive models of
complex biological processes where experiments are not feasible. Of course, simulations
are only as good as the quality of the data and the accuracy of the mathematical
abstraction of the biological processes. The first phase of the Blue Brain Project
therefore started after 15 years of systematically dissecting the microanatomical,
genetic and electrical properties of the elementary unit of the neocortex – a single
neocortical column, which is a little larger than the head of a pin. From the data
gathered from 15,000 experiments in rat somatosensory cortex, it became possible to begin
constructing a model of this part of the brain.

The project has focused, however, not only on building a model of the neocortical column,
but on developing a generic facility that could allow rapid modeling, simulation and
experimentation of any brain region, if the data can be measured and provided according
to specifications. The facility has been used to build the first model of the neocortical
column, which consists of 10,000 3D digitizations of real neurons that are populated with
model ion channels constrained by the genetic makeup of over 200 different types of
neurons. A parallel supercomputer  is used to build the model and perform the experiments
so that the behavior of the tissue can be predicted through simulations.

With the present simulation facility, the technical feasibility to model a piece of
neural tissue has been demonstrated. The next steps will involve expansion of the project
in two directions. First, the Blue Brain team is intensifying its efforts to extend the
facility to support modeling of the subcellular domain, which will integrate additional
levels of biological detail into the existing neocortical column model. Incorporating the
molecular level structures, processes and effects is an important step towards
pharmacological and medical research “in silico”. Second, the facility will be extended
to integrate details of larger portions of cortex and other brain structures. Ultimately,
given additional resources, the facility can be extended to permit whole brain modeling,
simulation and experimentation.

  * [http://www.biota.org Biota.org] - The Artificial Life Project
{{{
Biota.org was created in 1996 to promote and assist in the engineering of artificial life: complete, biologically-inspired, synthetic ecosystems and organisms.
This involved the creation and deployment of digital tools and environments for simulation, research, and learning about living systems both natural and artificial.
These tools ranged from simple genetic algorithms to full multi-user virtual environments.
The dissemination of interdisciplinary concepts is an important aspect of promoting the field of artificial life.
To this end, Biota.org welcomes members from all scientific disciplines including
evolutionary science, microbiology, medicine, computer science, robotics, nano-technology, palaeontology, social science, and artificial intelligence.
Biota also encourages artists, technologists, philosophers, and educators to join in and
add their input to the developing body of experimental work.

  * [http://http://www.nobleape.com Noble Ape], [http://code.google.com/p/nobleapesim nobleapesim] - create a detailed biological environment and a cognitive simulation
{{{
It features a number of autonomous simulation components including a landscape simulation, 
biological simulation, weather simulation, sentient creature (Noble Ape) simulation and 
a simple intelligent-agent scripting language (ApeScript). 
The cognitive simulation is relatively central to the hardcoded version of 
the Simulation and optional (on by default) in the ApeScript version of the sentient simulation. 
This gives some freedom in the agent simulation method used through ApeScript. 
Advanced ApeScript users may turn the cognitive simulation off and uses the "brain space" as actual memory.

The landscape (physics) and weather simulations are autonomous components of the Noble Ape Simulation too. 
The weather simulation can work in either flat or spherical environments similar to the landscape simulation.

The biological simulation is based on quantum mechanics.
The landscape shape (height values, surface area, slopes, angle to simulated sun) 
can be the source of all the biological properties of the environment.
This means for any landscape, a (long term) stable biological environment can exist and
include a wide variety of plants and animals in the simulated ecosystem.

== Soft/Evolution-related ==

  * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyworld Polyworld] - one of the earliest and one of the most sophisticated artificial worlds developed to study Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence
{{{
Polyworld is a computational ecology that I developed to explore issues in Artificial Life. 
Simulated organisms reproduce sexually, fight and kill and eat each other, eat the food that grows throughout the world,
and either develop successful strategies for survival or die.
An organism entire behavioral suite (move, turn, attack, eat, mate, light) is controlled 
by its neural network "brain". 

Each brain architecture - its neural wiring diagram - is determined from its genetic code, 
in terms of number, size, and composition of neural clusters (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and 
the types of connections between those clusters (connection density and topological mapping). 
Synaptic efficacy is modulated via Hebbian learning, so, in principle, the organisms have the ability 
to learn during the course of their lifetimes. 
The organisms perceive their world through a sense of vision, provided by a computer graphic 
rendering of the world from each organism point of view. 

The organisms physiologies are also encoded genetically, so both brain and body, and
thus all components of behavior, evolve over multiple generations. 
A variety of "species", with varying individual and group survival strategies have
emerged in various simulations, displaying such complex ethological behaviors as
swarming/flocking, foraging, and attack avoidance.

  * [http://code.google.com/p/cyberneticbacteria cyberneticbacteria] - an art project involving communicating bacteria, RFID tags, bluetooth phones and an artificial life simulation
{{{
The world’s first "prokaryotic scale free network" has been initiated. 
The scientist, unconcerned with the ethical implications of his experiment and also unaware of the artist’s intentions, 
never anticipated that the fusion of the Earth’s global bacterial communications network,
with that of human origin would lead to the evolution of a novel and chimeric life form.
A new kind of pathogen mutated by the Bluetooth, RFID and Packet Data surveilled in the gallery.
Dublin became the centre of the epidemic, and the origin of a new life form able to subvert both biology and technology.
What followed was inevitable.
What else would a creature with access to: humanity’s entire digital knowledge; the genetic toolbox that drives evolution;
the sophistication of the pathogen; and intimate awareness of our vulnerabilities do?

This page is intended to collect the information regarding all projects related to artificial life or artificial intelligence.

  * [http://code.google.com/p/ob-flash ob-flash] - an artificial chemistry puzzle and experimentation kit, implemented in Flash
{{{
A 2D world of bouncing atoms is directed by adding simple reactions, such as:  a3+b7 -> a4b4
With the right reactions you can create replicating molecules and evolution.
ob-flash is still at a very early stage. There's a moving prototype here but that's about it.

  * [http://code.google.com/p/elsass elsass] - 2D artificial life ecosystem simulation
{{{
Simulates 2D terrain water flow, weather, plant growth as well as animal senses and behavior.
Uses Chipmunk physics library and Clanlib for GUI. This is not your typical "matrix of colorful pixels" alife simulation. 
More like aiming to be environment for persistent and meaninful video game world.
}}}
  * [http://code.google.com/p/freality freality] - lots of experimental code on a variety of subjects. Some highlighted packages:
{{{
ai
 - control networks
 - pattern matching 
al
 - genetics 
logic (predicate logic statements)
ml (machine learning)
 - backpropagation neural network
 - naive bayes 
social
 - economics
 - highway traffic 
}}}
  * [http://code.google.com/p/floatworld floatworld] - neural-network based artificial life environment for simulating evolution
{{{
Floatworld is an artificial life environment in which 'creatures' compete for space and energy. 
Each creature is controlled by a neural network, and harvests energy in order to reproduce. 
Random mutation and natural selection result in the evolution of different strategies.
}}}
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cyberneticbacteria cyberneticbacteria] - an art project involving communicating bacteria, RFID tags, bluetooth phones and an artificial life simulation
{{{
The world’s first "prokaryotic scale free network" has been initiated. 
The scientist, unconcerned with the ethical implications of his experiment and also unaware of the artist’s intentions, 
never anticipated that the fusion of the Earth’s global bacterial communications network,
with that of human origin would lead to the evolution of a novel and chimeric life form.
A new kind of pathogen mutated by the Bluetooth, RFID and Packet Data surveilled in the gallery.
Dublin became the centre of the epidemic, and the origin of a new life form able to subvert both biology and technology.
What followed was inevitable.
What else would a creature with access to: humanity’s entire digital knowledge; the genetic toolbox that drives evolution;
the sophistication of the pathogen; and intimate awareness of our vulnerabilities do?

  * [http://code.google.com/p/flockediflock flockediflock] - flocking algorithms
{{{
Giving a go on flocking algorithms, rendered by a very basic 3d engine.
The aim is to gain understanding of the workings of flocking. This project should at its
term contain preys and predators that will switch behaviors depending on the situation. }}}
  * [http://code.google.com/p/ekology ekology] - an ecosystem simulation framework
{{{
EKology is a Java framework to create simulations of any modelled ecosystem.
It can be used for model & final state machine testing and optimization, visual simulation or just for fun :).
As part of my final thesis I developed not only the framework itself, but also a version of the fungus eater problem.
Here the proposed solution is based on artificial life and evolutionary processes.

  * [http://code.google.com/p/aamas08 aamas08] - assignment of the Autonomous Agents and Multi Agent Systems (AAMAS) course of the MAPi joint doctoral program
{{{
Objective:
 * Use a recurrent neural network to control the movements of a tadpole, swimming in a pond. 

Current Features:
 * Homeostasis
 * Proprioception
 * Neural Plasticity
 * Data Logging
 * Various kinds of charts
     o Neural Evolution
     o Neural Connections
     o Neural Histogram
     o Timeseries charts
     o 2D Macro Visualization 
 * Flexible Interface (charts can be maximized, closed and dragged around)

This page is intended to collect the information regarding all projects related to artificial life or artificial intelligence.

  * ob-flash - an artificial chemistry puzzle and experimentation kit, implemented in Flash
{{{
A 2D world of bouncing atoms is directed by adding simple reactions, such as:  a3+b7 -> a4b4
With the right reactions you can create replicating molecules and evolution.
ob-flash is still at a very early stage. There's a moving prototype here but that's about it. 
}}}
  * elsass - 2D artificial life ecosystem simulation
{{{
Simulates 2D terrain water flow, weather, plant growth as well as animal senses and behavior. Uses Chipmunk physics library and Clanlib for GUI. This is not your typical "matrix of colorful pixels" alife simulation. More like aiming to be environment for persistent and meaninful video game world.
}}}
  * odla - Lots of experimental code on a variety of subjects. Some highlighted packages:
{{{
ai
 - control networks
 - pattern matching 
al
 - genetics 
logic (predicate logic statements)
ml (machine learning)
 - backpropagation neural network
 - naive bayes 
social
 - economics
 - highway traffic

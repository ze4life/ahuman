Memory Prediction research covers using HTM/Memory Prediction theory for memorizing and recognizing complex patterns, produce internal representation.

== Terms ==

  * *short-term memory* - lasts for max 18 seconds
  * *long-term memory* - lasts for day or years (undergo forgetting process) - declarative and procedural
  * *declarative memory* - all memories that are consciously available - episodic and semantic
  * *episodic memory* - memory for specific events in time
  * *semantic memory* - knowledge about the external world
  * *procedural memory* - how to perform certain motor behaviour

== Long-term memory (LTM) ==

as per [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory Wikipedia]:
  * *declarative memory* - encoded by hippocampus (also by enthorinal and perirhinal) but consolidated somewhere else - probably in temporal cortex
  * *procedural memory* - encoded and probably stored in cerebellum / striatum
  * *emotional memory* - related to amygdala

== Sensory Neocortex ==

  * recognize and predict functions, as per Jeff Hawkins
  * long-term memory formation by hippocampus - how it is related to neocortex?
  * do we have short-term memory in neocortex?

*Current Understanding*:
  * information is supplied by discrete events (not as ongoing flow) - e.g. saccades, which supply fragmentary information to visual neocortex 3 times per second
  * neocortex holds generalization structures, averaged perceived information, not episodic memory
  * association cortex and frontal cortex (holds feelings) supply feedback via cingulate gyrus to sensory cortex and hippocampus
   * associations and emotionally stressed data are stored easier
  * temporal cortex (TC) lies between visual sensory cortex (VC) and hippocampus (HC)
   * LTM is not stored by hippocampus, but hippocampus is absolutely required to create LTM as per HM patient
   * hippocampus is not required to keep short-term memory (18 seconds)
   * most appropriate place for LTM is temporal cortex
   * VC perceives primary sensory information and transforms to stable internal representation
   * VC -> TC flow supplies flow of internal representations, or signal of inability to recognize/predict; TC -> VC is unclear
   * HC -> TC flow represents control of memorising by hippocampus

Memory Prediction research covers using HTM/Memory Prediction theory for memorizing and recognizing complex patterns, produce internal representation.

== Terms ==

  * *short-term memory* - lasts for max 18 seconds
  * *long-term memory* - lasts for day or years (undergo forgetting process) - declarative and procedural
  * *declarative memory* - all memories that are consciously available - episodic and semantic
  * *episodic memory* - memory for specific events in time
  * *semantic memory* - knowledge about the external world
  * *procedural memory* - how to perform certain motor behaviour

== Long-term memory ==

as per [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory Wikipedia]:
  * *declarative memory* - encoded by hippocampus (also by enthorical and perirhinal) but consolidated somewhere else - probably in temporal cortex
  * *procedural memory* - encoded and probably stored in cerebellum / striatum
  * *emotional memory* - related to amygdala

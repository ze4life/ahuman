= Project Phases / Steps =

A lot is to be done on Wiki, but generally it is in a good shape:

== 1. Create Wiki framework - *done* ==
----

The most active stage is this one:

== 2. Create team framework and agree on most essential features ==

  * Setup stable and transparent (documented) development environment
  * Freeze vision
  * Create exact high-level design, which fits the vision
  * Create component diagram, with one main function per component
  * Choose AI technology set for each of the component
  * Specify component interface

----

Real coding currently can be done for below only:

== 3. Integrate known AI libraries ==

  * Neural networks
  * Markov process/Reinforcement Learning
  * HTM/Belief Networks

----

The first meaningful result can be achieved in:

== 4. Create *aMatter* ==

  * Demonstrate Cognition/Self-Learning features
  * Demonstrate Feeling Feature
  * Running shared instance

----

Until completion of previous steps any activity for below ones should be avoided:

== 5. Create *aChild* ==

  * Demonstrate Personality Features
  * Demonstrate Thinking Process
  * Running live instance

== 6. Create *aHuman* ==

  * Demonstrate Comptence in Specific Area
  * Demonstrate ability to bring value

= Development Approach =

  * Use Time Window / Staged Delivery method - see [DevelopmentCycle]
  * Use free Open Sources tools and libraries

==Next Release==

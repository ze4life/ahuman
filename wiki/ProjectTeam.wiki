== A Few Words About Yourself ==

*Vladimir Savchik*:

I found AI quite interesting area and it is so challenging that it requires all the accumulated Software Engineering skills. I'd like to create a great and interesting thing for the people, not for money. I have seen and participated in many projects so I know a lot of bad and good examples of development. Will be glad to share this experience with novice programmers or exchange with experienced ones. vsavchik@gmail.com.

My time zone: 
Russia, Moscow.

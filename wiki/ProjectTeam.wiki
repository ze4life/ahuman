== A Few Words About Yourself ==

*Vladimir Savchik*:

I found AI quite interesting area and it is so challenging that it requires all the accumulated Software Engineering skills. I'd like to create a great and interesting thing for the people, not for money. I have seen and participated in many projects so I know a lot of bad and good examples of development. Will be glad to share this experience with novice programmers or exchange with experienced ones. vsavchik@gmail.com.

My time zone: 
GMT+3. Available in the evenings.

*Sarbjit Singh*:

I am Sarbjit Singh ,a programmer by profession and have 5 years experience (in 2009) in software industry. I always wanted to make a breakthrough in the software world and I think its a opportunity in which we can change the way world lives, the way we get information, the way we learn. AI has lot of potential and we can exploit this to create some interesting things. I am willing to share my experience in industry if some one needs it. sarbjit.longia@gmail.com

*Quentin Valdeyron*

I am currently 4th year Epitech student, fascinate by complex machines and human reasoning. Ahuman appears to me as the way to merge both of these. I worked on man-machine interaction before realizing that we are actually able to do better than an simple interface between one world to another. I am hoping that A.L will take us to a deeper understanding of human fonctionning which could be the beginning of an healthier world.
If someone wanna share this idea on the subject. ergo.quentin@gmail.com

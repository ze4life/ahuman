Dictionary items are structured by usage pattern (links below) and on any given page - grouped by subsection depending on page, and then 2-level lists where leaf-level item is subtype of first-level item.
Any sub-sub-items should placed near the same.

Still if you feel that something is quite essential - add dictionary item page and fill in any description (please follow Wikipedia approach to create fair information).

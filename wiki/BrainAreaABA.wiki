{{{
- ABA.EAR output is auditory nerve to ABA.COCHLEA = cranial nerve VIII
- ABA.COCHLEA through the medulla to contralateral ABA.SOC
- ABA.COCHLEA into pons nucleus of lateral lemniscus
- nucleus of lateral lemniscus projects to ABA.IC
- outer and middle ear, not part of Nervous System - transfer audio waves mechanically to cochlea
- working point and effectiveness is under control of 
central auditory system (CAS) through olivo-cochlear bundle (OCB)
feedback from superior olivary complex (SOC)
- ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) and dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN):
both structures show tonotopic maps

Below are most interesting thoughts, from my point of view, 
of article by Stephen Grossberg, founder of computational neurobiology, 
named "Cortical and subcortical predictive dynamics and learning during
perception, cognition, emotion and action", 2008.

= 1. INTRODUCTION =

  * realtime learning - from 2 *complementary streams* - ventral "what" (LGN/PV -> V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> IT -> LPFC) and dorsal "where" (V1 -> V2 -> MT -> PPC -> LPFC)
   * *what*: excitatory matching and match-based learning to create predictive representations of objects and events in the world
   * *where*: inhibitory matching and mismatch-based learning to continually update spatial maps and sensory-motor gains as our bodily parameters change through time

  * "what" stream learns *spatially invariant object categories*
  * "where" stream learns *spatial maps* and *movement gains*
  * "what"–"where" interstream interactions enable spatially invariant object representations to *control actions towards desired goals* in space
  * *perceptual* and *cognitive* learning control *spatial/motor* learning

= 2. LEARNING OF INVARIANT RECOGNITION CATEGORIES =

  * categories that tend to be increasingly independent of object size and position at higher cortical levels (ITa is invariant)
  * fast learning without catastrophic forgetting - *ART model*
   * integrate properties of consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance and synchrony (CLEARS)
   * *excitatory resonanse* when match between learned top-down pattern and bottom-up input
   * focused attention on critical feature pattern
   * resonanse forses fast incorporation of such patterns into category
  * solves *stability-plasticity dilemma* - learn quickly without experiencing catastrophic forgetting
   * all *conscious states are resonant states*
   * animals pay *attention to salient objects*
   * learning one-to-many (many views of one category) and many-to-one (know many things about object) maps

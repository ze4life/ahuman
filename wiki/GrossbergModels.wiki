Below are most interesting thoughts, from my point of view, of article by Stephen Grossberg, founder of computational neurobiology, named "Cortical and subcortical predictive dynamics and learning during perception, cognition, emotion and action", 2008.

= 1. INTRODUCTION =

  * realtime learning - from 2 *complementary streams* - ventral "what" (LGN/PV -> V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> IT) and dorsal "where" (V1 -> V2 -> MT -> PPC)
   * *what*: excitatory matching and match-based learning to create predictive representations of objects and events in the world
   * *where*: inhibitory matching and mismatch-based learning to continually update spatial maps and sensory-motor gains as our bodily parameters change through time

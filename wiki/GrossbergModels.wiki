Below are most interesting thoughts, from my point of view, 
of article by Stephen Grossberg, founder of computational neurobiology, 
named "Cortical and subcortical predictive dynamics and learning during
perception, cognition, emotion and action", 2008.

= 1. INTRODUCTION =

  * realtime learning - from 2 *complementary streams* - ventral "what" (LGN/PV -> V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> IT -> LPFC) and dorsal "where" (V1 -> V2 -> MT -> PPC -> LPFC)
   * *what*: excitatory matching and match-based learning to create predictive representations of objects and events in the world
   * *where*: inhibitory matching and mismatch-based learning to continually update spatial maps and sensory-motor gains as our bodily parameters change through time

  * "what" stream learns *spatially invariant object categories*
  * "where" stream learns *spatial maps* and *movement gains*
  * "what"–"where" interstream interactions enable spatially invariant object representations to *control actions towards desired goals* in space
  * *perceptual* and *cognitive* learning control *spatial/motor* learning

= 2. LEARNING OF INVARIANT RECOGNITION CATEGORIES =

  * categories that tend to be increasingly independent of object size and position at higher cortical levels (ITa is invariant)
  * fast learning without catastrophic forgetting - *ART model*
   * integrate properties of consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance and synchrony (CLEARS)
   * *excitatory resonanse* when match between learned top-down pattern and bottom-up input
   * focused attention on critical feature pattern
   * resonanse forces fast incorporation of such patterns into category

http://ahuman.googlecode.com/svn/images/wiki/research/biomodel/grossberg-art.jpg

  * solves *stability-plasticity dilemma* - learn quickly without experiencing catastrophic forgetting
   * all *conscious states are resonant states*
   * animals pay *attention to salient objects*
   * learning one-to-many (many views of one category) and many-to-one (know many things about object) maps

= 3. EXPECTATIONS AND BIASED COMPETITION =

  * it was mathematically proved that the simplest network which solves the stability–plasticity dilemma is a *top-down, modulatory on-centre, off-surround network*
   * excitatory priming of features in the on-centre
   * inhibition in the off-surround
  * it was termed as *biased competition*

= 4. IMAGINING AND PLANNING AHEAD =

  * excitatory/inhibitory balance in the modulatory on-centre of a top-down expectation can be modified by *volitional control from the basal ganglia*
  * if these volitional signals become tonically hyperactive, then top-down expectations can fire without overt intention, leading to properties such as schizophrenic hallucinations

= 5. EXPECTED VERSUS UNEXPECTED EVENTS =

  * match-based learning stabilizes learned memories in both the bottom-up and top-down adaptive filters
  * top-down expectations can also predictively prime events whose future occurrence is sought

= 6. SPIKES, SYNCHRONY AND ATTENTIVE LEARNING =

  * synchronous matching ART (*SMART*) model predicts CLEARS from muti-level brain organization and provides:
   * unified functional explanation of single-cell properties, such as spiking dynamics, spike-timing-dependent plasticity and acetylcholine modulation
   * detailed laminar thalamic and cortical circuit designs and their interactions
   * aggregate cell recordings, such as current source densities and local field potentials
   * single cell and large-scale inter-areal oscillations in the gamma and beta frequency domains

http://ahuman.googlecode.com/svn/images/wiki/research/biomodel/grossberg-smart.jpg

  * SMART predicts that *matches cause gamma oscillations* that support attention, resonance, learning and consciousness, whereas *mismatches inhibit learning by causing slower beta oscillations* during reset and hypothesis testing operations that are initiated in the deeper cortical layers
   * beta oscillations in deeper cortical layers
   * beta oscillations during partial attention shifts
   * beta oscillations during hippocampal place cell learning in novel environments
   * *hippocampal place cells can develop within seconds to minutes, and can remain stable for months*
   * beta power was very low as a mouse traversed a lap for the first time, grew to full strength on the second and third laps, became low again after 2 min of exploration, and remained low on subsequent days
  * beta oscillation power also correlated with the rate at which place cells became *spatially selective*
   * top-down adaptive weights are large before learning occurs, so that they can match whatever input pattern first initiates the learning of a new category
   * weights are pruned on subsequent learning trials to match the emerging critical feature pattern during mismatchbased reset events
   * low beta power on the first lap of exploration can be explained by the initial top-down match 
   * beta power on subsequent laps can be explained by mismatch events that correlate with the rate at which place cells become spatially selective

= 7. COGNITIVE–EMOTIONAL INTERACTIONS =

  * *invariant recognition categories* can be activated when objects are experienced, but without emotional value of these objects
   * can be *associated* through reinforcement learning with one or more *drive representations* (internal drive states and emotions)
   * activation of drive representation by invariant object category can *trigger emotional reactions and motivational decisions* that can motivationally modulate object representations
   * recognized objects can hereby *trigger choice and release of actions* that realize goals in context-sensitive way
  * *CogEM* model represents three types of interacting representations (sensory, drive and motor), as they control three types of learning (conditioned reinforcer, incentive motivational and motor) during reinforcement learning 
   * sensory representations S temporarily store internal representations of sensory events in working memory; drive representations D are the sites where reinforcing and homeostatic, or drive, cues converge to activate emotional responses; motor representations M control read-out of actions
   * *conditioned reinforcer learning* enables sensory events to activate emotional reactions at drive representations
   * *incentive motivational learning* enables emotions to generate a motivational set that biases the system to process information consistent with that emotion
   * *motor learning* allows sensory and cognitive representations to generate actions

  * visually perceived objects are called *conditioned stimuli* (CSi), invariant object categories that they activate are called *sensory representations* (SCSi), which, in turn, activate *drive representations* (D)
  * *amygdala* is drive representation, sends projections to PFC
   * reinforcement learning can covert CS1, that activates SCS1-1 into *conditioned reinforcer* by strengthening the associative links from SCS1-1 to D (e.g. learning in IT -> AM pathways)
   * SCS1-1 can also send excitatory projections to SCS1-2 (regions of prefrontal cortex, PFC)
   * reinforcement learning strengthen AM-to-PFC pathways, which provide *incentive motivation* to PFC representations
  * SCS1-2 send top-down feedback to SCS1-1

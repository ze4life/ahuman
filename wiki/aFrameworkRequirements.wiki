#summary Framework Requirements
@@[Home] -> [ProjectPlanning] -> [aFrameworkRequirements]
----

*Framework goals are:*
  * Setup stable and transparent (documented) development environment
  * Freeze vision
  * Create exact high-level design, which fits the vision
  * Create component diagram, with one main function per component
  * Choose AI technology set for each of the component
  * Specify component interface 

== Setup development environment ==

  * IDE - MS VisualStudio 2010 Express - see [DevelopmentEnvironment] (out of date, needs new IDE and project information)
  * High Level Architecture has version, last is HLAv3 - it defines how code is split into build targets, codebase folders, and defines core set of classes. All classes, folders and build targets projects have been created and included into build
  * Build is local from IDE, contains 3 separate build targets - platform, mind, aWee
  * Platform services are ready for use - providing generic functions like startup/shutdown, logging, configuring, thread management and alike
  * Mind is sole part of codebase, and is a long-term target for coding
  * aWee - is partial prototype of corresponding target from starting [aHuman] page

== Freeze Vision ==

  * High-level features of aHuman are available at [ProjectVision]
  * Implementation vision is to use neurobiology data:
   * high-level patterns - mind areas, their roles, connectivity and circuits
   * middle-level design - copy from well-known building blocks of human mind - cortex region, nucleus, bundles of fibers
   * low-level design - columnar design of cortex, temporal dynamics from action potentials, membrane potentials, firing spikes, fire delay

== High-level design ==

  * see [Architecture] - as a whole view, including component diagram
  * see [MindArchitecture] - for mind architecture

== Choose AI technology set for each of the component ==

  * finally decided to ignore findings in classical AI technology, because it is side-shifted, using old-fashion neural networks, crude models, aimed to build practical applications in the field of weak AI
  * aHuman neural networks need time dimension, two-way connectivity and specific middle-level design, which will direct networks to be effective and useful

== Specify component interface ==

  * it appears to be quite naive to build exact interface from the very beginning
  * still for the platform, mind area, mind region, neural links the certain interface was created

#summary Framework Requirements
@@[Home] -> [ProjectPlanning] -> [aFrameworkRequirements]
----

*Framework goals are:*
  * Setup stable and transparent (documented) development environment
  * Freeze vision
  * Create exact high-level design, which fits the vision
  * Create component diagram, with one main function per component
  * Choose AI technology set for each of the component
  * Specify component interface 

== Setup development environment ==

  * IDE - MS Visual C++ 2010 Express - see [DevelopmentEnvironment] (out of date, needs new IDE and project information)
  * High Level Architecture has version, last is HLAv3 - it defines how code is split into build targets, codebase folders, and defines core set of classes. All classes, folders and build targets projects have been created and included into build
  * Build is local from IDE, contains 3 separate build targets - platform, mind, aWee
  * Platform services are ready for use - providing generic functions like startup/shutdown, logging, configuring, thread management and alike
  * Mind is sole part of codebase, and is a long-term target for coding
  * aHuman - is mind modeling tool using biological model
  * aWee - is partial prototype of corresponding target from starting [http://code.google.com/p/ahuman aHuman] page

== Freeze Vision ==

  * High-level features of aHuman are available at [ProjectVision]
  * Implementation vision is to use neurobiology data:
   * high-level patterns - mind areas, their roles, connectivity and circuits
   * middle-level design - copy from well-known building blocks of human mind - cortex region, nucleus, bundles of fibers
   * low-level design - columnar design of cortex, temporal dynamics from action potentials, membrane potentials, firing spikes, fire delay

== High-level design ==

  * see [Architecture] - as a whole view, including component diagram
  * see [MindArchitecture] - for mind architecture

== Choose AI technology set for each of the component ==

  * finally decided to ignore findings in classical AI technology, because it is side-shifted, using old-fashion neural networks, crude models, aimed to build practical applications in the field of weak AI
  * aHuman neural networks need time dimension, two-way connectivity and specific middle-level design, which will direct networks to be effective and useful

== Specify component interface ==

  * it appears to be quite naive to build exact interface from the very beginning
  * still for the platform, mind area, mind region, neural links the certain interface was created
  * now, after several years of reading and thinking about neurobiology, I can guess what is human mind and what are its services in computational terms:
{{{
Lower Brain: 
- peripheral control
- motor reflexes
- autonomic control
- locomotion
- modulatory control

Forebrain Mind: 
- execution control
- memory handling
- motivations

Neocortical Brain: 
- sensory aggregation
- body aggregation
- motor aggregation
- execution planning
- personality
}}}

== Specify work plan to complete phase ==

  * define aHuman tracts paths
  * rework mind to resolve all model inconsistencies
  * change mind interfaces and lifecycle
  * refactor mind areas to services
  * move links to mind areas/services
  * create services prototypes
  * create mind by services in aHuman programmatically
  * ensure the same mind can be created
  * group mind area items into circuit instances
  * visualize circuit instances on area pages

== 2015 book of work ==

  * 01-apr: finish FAM - done
  * 01-may: finish hippocampal formation model
  * 01-jun: finish neocortial model
  * 15-jun: migrate to ahuman.org
  * 01-jul: add integral component pages
  * 01-aug: add full-coverage of 3d-circuits
  * 01-sep: finish tract information
  * 01-nov: add integral circuits
  * 01-dec: quick full review
  * end of 2015: publish model overview, state complete

*Article:*
  * Predictive Feedback Can Account for Biphasic Responses in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, 2009 - Janneke F. M. Jehee, Dana H. Ballard

= Abstract =

  * *biphasic neural response* - best response when quick switching between two opposite patterns - detected in LGN, V1, MT
  * article describes: *hierarchical model of predictive coding* and simulations that capture these temporal variations in neuronal response properties
  * focus on the *LGN-V1 circuit*
  * after training on natural images the model exhibits the brain’s LGN-V1 connectivity structure:
   * structure of V1 receptive fields is linked to the spatial alignment and properties of center-surround cells in the LGN
   * spatio-temporal response profile of LGN model neurons is biphasic in structure, resembling the biphasic response structure of neurons in cat LGN
   * model displays a specific pattern of influence of feedback, where LGN receptive fields that are aligned over a simple cell receptive field zone of the same polarity decrease their responses while neurons of opposite polarity increase their responses with feedback
  * predictive feedback is a general coding strategy in the brain

= Introduction =

  * layout of V1-to-LGN feedback connections follows the structure of LGN-to-V1 feedforward connections
  * LGN cells have center-surround organization
  * LGN regions switch between bright- to dark-excitatory in 20 ms
   * what computational reason can change preferred simulus
   * biphasic dynamics follow from neural mechanisms of *predictive coding*
  * to be efficient - early-level visual processing removes correlations in the input, resulting in a more sparse and statistically independent output
   * early visual areas remove correlations by removing the predictable components in their input
   * center-surround structure of LGN receptive fields can be explained using predictive coding mechanisms - center pixel intensity value can be replaced with the difference between the center value and a prediction from a linear weighted sum of its surrounding values
  * works for interaction of lower-order and higher-order visual areas
   * low-order and high-order visual areas are reciprocally connected
   * higher-level receptive fields represent the predictions of the visual world
   * lower-level areas signal the error between predictions and actual visual input
   * explains end-stopping

= Results =

== Hierarchical model of predictive coding ==

  * two layers - LGN and V1
  * Steps
   * 1. V1 receives input from LGN
   * 2. V1 neuron with receptive field best matched the input, feeds its prediction back to LGN
   * 3. LGN neurons compute error between prediction and actual input
   * 4. LGN sends error forward to correct prediction
   * 5. process is repeated, single feedforward-feedback cycle takes around 20 milliseconds
  * connection weights of the model are adapted to the input by minimizing the description length or entropy of the joint distribution of inputs and neural responses
   * minimizes the model’s prediction errors
   * improves the sparseness of the neural code
   * model converges to a set of connection weights that is optimal for
predicting that input

== LGN-V1 connectivity structure after training ==

  * feedforward connection weights from on-center type and off-center type LGN cells coding for the same spatial location are summed for each of the model’s 128 V1 cells
   * V1 responses in the model are linear across their on and off inputs
   * after training, the receptive fields show orientation tuning as found for simple cells in V1
  * relation between the learned receptive fields in model V1 and the properties of LGN units:
   * connections are initially random and are adjusted as a consequence of the model’s learning rule together with exposure to natural images
   * after training, on- and off-center units are spatially aligned with the on- and off-zones of the model V1 receptive field

== Reversal of polarity due to predictive feedback ==

  * first consider a *model with non-biphasic inputs*
   * spatio-temporal response of model on-center type geniculate cells is calculated using a reverse correlation algorithm
   * as in cat LGN, model on-center type receptive fields are arranged in center and surround, and the bright-excitatory phase is followed by a dark-excitatory phase
   * removing feedback in the model causes the previously biphasic responses to disappear
  * then model is modified to *simulate biphasic retinal inputs*
   * temporal response profile of model on-center type cells is obtained using reverse correlation
   * predictive feedback interactions cause reversals of polarity in LGN to be more pronounced than the retinal input
  * why *biphasic responses appear in the mapped model LGN receptive fields*
   * reverse correlation leads to visual changes occurring much faster than most natural input the system would encode
   * consider stimulus consisting primarily of bright regions
   * on-center type LGN cells will respond to the onset of this stimulus
   * on zones in the LGN are linked to on zones of receptive fields in V1, which soon start to increase activation and make predictions
   * by the time that predictions of the first stimulus arrive in lower-level areas, areas, the initial representation of the bright stimulus has been replaced by a second white noise stimulus, and the prediction is compared against a new and unexpected stimulus representation
   * in reverse correlation, predictive processing shows up as a comparison against this running average whitenoise stimulation
   * predicted bright region is of higher luminance than the average second stimulus, causing off-center type cells to respond to the offset of the bright reference stimulus
  * reversals in polarity of model LGN cells are most profound in a small time window after presentation of the reference stimulus but disappear gradually later on
   * initial prediction is dynamically updated to include predictions of stimuli presented after the reference stimulus
   * new predictions are closer to the average white-noise stimulation
   * reversals in polarity will appear as long as predictions deviate from the average white-noise stimulation
   * precise amount of overlap between prediction and stimulus is not critical
  * simple cell off-zones mediate inhibitory influences to off-center LGN cells and excitatory influences to on-center LGN cells
  * for all model on or off-center LGN receptive fields that are aligned over a V1 receptive field region of the same polarity, firing rates decrease due to feedback
  * where the overlapping fields are of reversed polarity, there is an increase in firing rate
  * neurophysiology: influence of V1 simple cells on LGN on- and off-cells is phase-reversed

  * Predictive Feedback Can Account for Biphasic Responses in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, 2009 - Janneke F. M. Jehee, Dana H. Ballard

= Abstract =

  * *biphasic neural response* - best response when quick switching between two opposite patterns - detected in LGN, V1, MT
  * article describes: *hierarchical model of predictive coding* and simulations that capture these temporal variations in neuronal response properties
  * focus on the *LGN-V1 circuit*
  * after training on natural images the model exhibits the brainâ€™s LGN-V1 connectivity structure:
   * structure of V1 receptive fields is linked to the spatial alignment and properties of center-surround cells in the LGN
   * spatio-temporal response profile of LGN model neurons is biphasic in structure, resembling the biphasic response structure of neurons in cat LGN
   * model displays a specific pattern of influence of feedback, where LGN receptive fields that are aligned over a simple cell receptive field zone of the same polarity decrease their responses while neurons of opposite polarity increase their responses with feedback
  * predictive feedback is a general coding strategy in the brain

= Introduction =

  * LGN cells have center-surround organization
  * LGN regions switch between bright- to dark-excitatory in 20 ms
   * what computational reason can change preferred simulus
   * biphasic dynamics follow from neural mechanisms of *predictive coding*
  * to be efficient - early-level visual processing removes correlations in the input, resulting in a more sparse and statistically independent output
   * early visual areas remove correlations by removing the predictable components in their input
   * center-surround structure of LGN receptive fields can be explained using predictive coding mechanisms - center pixel intensity value can be replaced with the difference between the center value and a prediction from a linear weighted sum of its surrounding values
  * works for interaction of lower-order and higher-order visual areas
   * low-order and high-order visual areas are reciprocally connected
   * higher-level receptive fields represent the predictions of the visual world
   * lower-level areas signal the error between predictions and actual visual input
   * explains end-stopping

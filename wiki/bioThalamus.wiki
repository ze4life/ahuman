*inputs*
  * 90%-95% of synaptic inputs onto the relay cells, arise from local GABAergic neurons, reticular cells, and interneurons plus two main sources of extrinsic input, which are a feedback projection from layer 6 of cortex and an ascending projection from various scattered cell groups in the brainstem reticular formation
  * relayed inputs
   * sensory inputs
    * for LGB - 90%-95% of synaptic inputs onto the relay cells from retina
  * modulatory inputs
   * from cerebral cortex
   * limbic pathways make input
   * cerebellar and basal ganglia inputs
   * from reticular thalamic nucleus
   * from various brain stem areas

*functions:*
  * site where sensory inputs can be modulated
  * relay for cerebellar and basal ganglia inputs to the cerebral cortex
   * these are feedback pathways, since the cerebellum and basal ganglia respond to outputs from the cerebral cortex

*paths*
  * thalamus nucleus -> cortex -> thalamus nucleus (the same)
   * filtering thalamic inputs to the cerebral cortex

*contents*
  * many inhibitory interneurons
  * many neuromodulatory neurotransmitter systems (such as 5HT and NE systems) have terminations within thalamic nuclei
  * the relay cell to interneuron ratio is between 3 and 4 to one

== Divisions ==

  * anterior nucleus - *association* - connections similar to the LD nucleus 
  * lateral subnuclei 
   * reticular thalamic nucleus - *nonspecific* - brain stem reticular formation, cerebral cortex, thalamus -> inhibitory input to thalamic nuclei (arousal and alertness)
   * ventral tiers subnuclei (total 15 nuclei, project to neocortex)
    * ventral posterior nuclei (VP)
     * ventral posteromedial nuclei (VPM) - *ff/relay* - trigeminothalamic -> cortex
     * ventral posterolateral nuclei (VPL) - *ff/relay* - medial lemniscal and spinothalamic connections -> cortex
    * ventral lateral nuclei (VL) - *fb/relay* - cerebellum/dentate nucleus, basal ganglia -> primary motor, premotor cortex (motor feedback from the cerebellum and basal ganglia to the cerebral cortex)
    * ventral anterior nuclei (VA) - *fb/relay* - basal ganglia (medial globus pallidus, substantia nigra, parts reticulata) -> premotor cortex, supplementary motor area
   * dorsal tiers subnuclei
    * pulvinar (PV) - *association* - superior colliculus, association cortex -> secondary visual areas, association areas in parietotemporal region (visual perception and eye movements, probably relating to attention)
    * lateral posterior nuclei (LP) - *association* - like pulvinar
    * lateral dorsal nuclei (LD) - *association* - hippocampus ->  mamillary bodies -> LD -> posterior cingulate cortex (emotional learning)
  * medial subnuclei
   * medial dorsal nucleus (MD)
    * medial subdivision - *association* - solitary nucleus, substantia nigra reticulata, amygdala and ventral pallidum -> insular cortex, orbital frontal cortex and subcallosal region (autonomic regulation and emotions)
    * lateral subdivision - *association* - superior colliculus, olfactory cortex and the ventral pallidum -> frontal eye fields, anterior cingulate cortex (controlling eye movements, attending to visual stimuli, emotional tone)
   * midline nuclei - *nonspecific*
   * intralaminar nuclei
    * central median - *fb/relay* - (reciprocal connections with the globus pallidus and with the premotor cortex)
    * parafascicular nuclei - *nonspecific*
  * metathalamus (near pulvinar)
   * MGB - medial geniculate body (auditory relay nucleus) - *ff/relay* - tonotopically auditory afferents from inferior colliculus -> primary auditory cortex
   * LGB - lateral geniculate body (principal visual relay) - *ff/relay* - retinotopic input -> primary visual cortex

== Projection ==

  * each thalamic projection neuron can exist in one of two basic physiological states:
   * "tonic mode"
    * neurons respond like other neurons to depolarization and hyperpolarization
   * "burst mode"
    * oscillatory mode" 
    * neurons in this state have an intrinsic rythmicity
    * during sleep, most thalamic neurons are in burst mode
    * neurons cannot communicate specific information
    * if a novel stimulus is presented, the sudden change from burst to tonic mode may be a major factor in alerting the cortex

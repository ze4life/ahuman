  * this page is about dorsal thalamus (DTH=TH/D)
  * other parts of thalalus are:
   * ventral thalamus (TH/V) = RN, SVG, ZI
   * epithalamus = habenula, pineal gland

*inputs*
  * 90%-95% of synaptic inputs onto the relay cells, arise from:
   * local GABAergic neurons
   * reticular cells
   * interneurons
   * feedback projection from layer 6 of cortex 
   * ascending projection from various scattered cell groups in the brainstem reticular formation
  * relayed inputs
   * sensory inputs
  * modulatory inputs
   * from cerebral cortex
   * limbic pathways make input
   * cerebellar and basal ganglia inputs
   * from reticular thalamic nucleus
   * from various brain stem areas

*functions:*
  * site where sensory inputs can be modulated
  * relay for cerebellar and basal ganglia inputs to the cerebral cortex
   * these are feedback pathways, since the cerebellum and basal ganglia respond to outputs from the cerebral cortex

*paths*
  * thalamus nucleus -> cortex -> thalamus nucleus (the same)
   * filtering thalamic inputs to the cerebral cortex

*contents*
  * many inhibitory interneurons
  * many neuromodulatory neurotransmitter systems (such as 5HT and NE systems) have terminations within thalamic nuclei
  * the relay cell to interneuron ratio is between 3 and 4 to one

== Divisions ==

  * anterior nucleus (AN) - *association* - connections similar to the LD nucleus 
  * lateral subnuclei 
   * reticular thalamic nucleus - *nonspecific* - brain stem reticular formation, cerebral cortex, thalamus -> inhibitory input to thalamic nuclei (arousal and alertness)
   * ventral tiers subnuclei (total 15 nuclei, project to neocortex)
    * ventral posterior nuclei (VP)
     * ventral posteromedial nuclei (VPM) - *ff/relay* - trigeminothalamic -> cortex
     * ventral posterolateral nuclei (VPL) - *ff/relay* - medial lemniscal and spinothalamic connections -> cortex
    * ventral lateral nuclei (VL) - *fb/relay* - cerebellum/dentate nucleus, basal ganglia -> primary motor, premotor cortex (motor feedback from the cerebellum and basal ganglia to the cerebral cortex)
    * ventral anterior nuclei (VA) - *fb/relay* - basal ganglia (medial globus pallidus, substantia nigra, parts reticulata) -> premotor cortex, supplementary motor area
   * dorsal tiers subnuclei
    * pulvinar (PV) - *association* - superior colliculus, association cortex -> secondary visual areas, association areas in parietotemporal region (visual perception and eye movements, probably relating to attention)
    * lateral posterior nuclei (LP) - *association* - like pulvinar
    * lateral dorsal nuclei (LD) - *association* - hippocampus ->  mamillary bodies -> LD -> posterior cingulate cortex (emotional learning)
  * medial subnuclei
   * medial dorsal nucleus (MD)
    * medial subdivision - *association* - solitary nucleus, substantia nigra reticulata, amygdala and ventral pallidum -> insular cortex, orbital frontal cortex and subcallosal region (autonomic regulation and emotions)
    * lateral subdivision - *association* - superior colliculus, olfactory cortex and the ventral pallidum -> frontal eye fields, anterior cingulate cortex (controlling eye movements, attending to visual stimuli, emotional tone)
   * midline nuclei - *nonspecific*
   * intralaminar nuclei
    * central median - *fb/relay* - (reciprocal connections with the globus pallidus and with the premotor cortex)
    * parafascicular nuclei - *nonspecific*
  * metathalamus (near pulvinar)
   * MGB - medial geniculate body (auditory relay nucleus) - *ff/relay* - tonotopically auditory afferents from inferior colliculus -> primary auditory cortex
   * LGB - lateral geniculate body (principal visual relay) - *ff/relay* - retinotopic input -> primary visual cortex

== Projection ==

  * each thalamic projection neuron can exist in one of two basic physiological states:
   * "tonic mode"
    * neurons respond like other neurons to depolarization and hyperpolarization
   * "burst mode"
    * oscillatory mode" 
    * neurons in this state have an intrinsic rythmicity
    * during sleep, most thalamic neurons are in burst mode
    * neurons cannot communicate specific information
    * if a novel stimulus is presented, the sudden change from burst to tonic mode may be a major factor in alerting the cortex

== Functional View ==

*Sensory Relay:*
  * sensor/retina -> *DTH/V/LGB* -> PCA/V1 (1-order visual relay)
  * sensor/inferior colliculus -> *DTH/V/MGB* -> PCA/A1,2 (1-order auditory relay)
  * BSA/medial lemniscus, ALS, TTT, STT -> *DTH/V/VP* -> {PCA/S1,2,3 (1-order somatic relay); HCA/insula (1-order taste relay); ACA/M/4 (?)}
  * {BSA/anterior olfactory nucleus; SCA (pain)} -> *DTH/M/MD* -> {HCA/insula (1-order olfactory relay); ACA/PFC (1-order pain relay)}
  * {SCA; BSA/olfactory} -> *DTH/I/sheet* -> (diffuse)
  * BSA/SN,SC,PAG,CR -> *DTH/V/VM* -> ACA,PCA/layer1 (attention)

*Motor relay:*
  * {BSA/CR; BGA/GP,SN} -> *DTH/V/VL,VA* -> ACA/M,PM,SM
  * BGA/GP,SN -> *DTH/I/CM* -> ACA/M

*Association:*
  * (many) -> *DTH/L/PV* -> {PCA/occipital,parietal; HCA/temporal}
  * limbic/mammillary -> *DTH/A/AV,AM,AD* -> ACA/CG
  * limbic -> DTH/L/LD -> ACA/CG

== Axons terminated in Thalamus ==
 
  * 2 types - R (round) and E (extended), excitatory, using GLU
  * R-type terminals are characteristically large (3 nm in diameter), although variable in size and actual shape. They conform to the classical type-2 endings, as described in speciﬁc thalamic nuclei. The associated axonal terminations are concentrated in sharply delimited, round arbors and *carry of the order of 100 terminals*, that typically *end on proximal dendrites*
  * E-type axons have stalked or spinous terminations of classic type-1 corticothalamic endings. Their axonal terminal ﬁelds are elongated and quite extended (1–3 mm) and *carry between 500 and 1,000 E terminals* that typically *end on distal dendrites*
  * in the LGN (and in pulvinar), the driving input from the retina is provided by R-type axon terminals, with type-2 synapses; the input back from cortical area V1 has E-type axon terminals, with type-1 synapses - modulating input, (though there are many more E-type than R-type axons)
  * cortical E-type axons derive from medium to small pyramidal cells in the lower cortical layers. They are located in layer 6, and as a rule always have collaterals in the thalamic reticular nucleus
  * cortical R-type axons originate from pyramidal cells in cortical layer 5

== Axons terminated in Cortex ==

  * projections from thalamus to cortex also fall into two classes
  * ﬁrst type goes mainly into layer 4 or lower layer 3, with a minority also contacting processes in layer 6
   * projection cells in magno- and parvocellular laminae of LGN are prominent examples of such a connection that can very reliably drive cortical cells, despite their small number of synapses.
   * 2.8% of all excitatory synapses on a layer 4C spiny stellate cell originate from magnocellular cells in LGN
  * other type projects to layer 1, but not exclusively - modulating connection
   * examples - cells in the interlaminar zones of the LGN that project into the superﬁcial layers of V1
  * rules
   * (1) If a cortical area projects to a thalamic region from cortical layer 6, then if there is a reverse projection, it goes mainly into layer 4 or lower layer 3
   * (2) if a cortical area projects to a thalamic region from cortical layer 5, then if there is a reverse projection it avoids layer 4 and often goes mainly to cortical layer 1. These thalamocortical projections are usually much more diffuse than the layer 4 projection.

*inputs*
  * relayed inputs
   * sensory inputs
  * modulatory inputs
   * from cerebral cortex
   * limbic pathways make input
   * cerebellar and basal ganglia inputs
   * from reticular thalamic nucleus
   * from various brain stem areas

*functions:*
  * site where sensory inputs can be modulated
  * relay for cerebellar and basal ganglia inputs to the cerebral cortex
   * these are feedback pathways, since the cerebellum and basal ganglia respond to outputs from the cerebral cortex

*paths*
  * thalamus nucleus -> cortex -> thalamus nucleus (the same)
   * filtering thalamic inputs to the cerebral cortex

*contents*
  * many inhibitory interneurons
  * many neuromodulatory neurotransmitter systems (such as 5HT and NE systems) have terminations within thalamic nuclei

== Divisions ==

  * anterior nucleus 
  * lateral subnuclei 
   * reticular thalamic nucleus
   * ventral tiers subnuclei
    * ventral posterior nuclei (VP)
     * ventral posteromedial nuclei (VPM)
     * ventral posterolateral nuclei (VPL)
    * ventral lateral nuclei (VL)
    * ventral anterior nuclei (VA)
   * dorsal tiers subnuclei
    * pulvinar
    * lateral posterior nuclei (LP)
    * lateral dorsal nuclei (LD)
  * medial subnuclei
   * medial dorsal nucleus (MD)
   * midline nuclei
   * intralaminar nuclei 
    * central median
    * parafascicular nuclei

== Projection ==

  * each thalamic projection neuron can exist in one of two basic physiological states:
   * "tonic mode"
    * neurons respond like other neurons to depolarization and hyperpolarization
   * "burst mode"
    * oscillatory mode" 
    * neurons in this state have an intrinsic rythmicity
    * during sleep, most thalamic neurons are in burst mode
    * neurons cannot communicate specific information
    * if a novel stimulus is presented, the sudden change from burst to tonic mode may be a major factor in alerting the cortex

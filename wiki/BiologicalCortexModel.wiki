#summary Biological Cortex Model
@@[Home] -> [NeoCortexResearch] -> [BiologicalCortexModel]
----

This page is intended to model real biological cortex on a level able to demonstrate intelligence features and show their implementation in brain.
Biological model add assumptions on top of biological features to make the whole set consistent and self-explanatory.

  * Biology data - 5 layers (plus 1 connectivity)
   * cells in columns have similar response properties
   * majority of connections are within layer
   * feed-forward connections are few but strong
   * layers 4 and 3 are primary feed-forward layers, layer 4 disappears if ascend hierarchy
  * Hypothesis
   * common mechanism in each layer
   * each layer is a sequence memory - learns transitions of sparse distributed patterns
   * layer 4 learns first order transitions - spatial inference, simple cells
   * layer 3 learns variable order transitions - time-based inference, complex cells
   * layer 5 motor
   * layers 2,6 - feedback, attention
   * all column cells fire when not predicted
  * Real neuron
   * proximity dendrites - linear summation, feed-forward, Nx100 synapses
   * distal dendrites - dozens of regions, non-linear integration, lateral connections, Nx1K synapses
   * ongoing forming and unforming of synapses
   * variable spike rate

== Biological Brain Hierarchy ==

    * *parahippocampal gyrus* (formation of spatial memory, encoding and recognition of scenes)
     * anterior parahippocampal gyrus
      * *perirhinal cortex* (visual perception and memory, facilitates recognition and identification of environmental stimuli)
      * *entorhinal cortex* (hub in a widespread network for memory and navigation, autobiographical/declarative/episodic memories, memory formation, memory consolidation, and memory optimization in sleep)
     * posterior parahippocampal gyrus

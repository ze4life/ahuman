== Simplified Biological Overview ==

  * head
   * sensors
   * sensor data tract
   * sensor control tract
   * brain
  * body (spinal cord)
   * effectors
   * body feeling components
   * body feeling data tract
   * body feeling modulation tract
   * effectors control tract
   * effectors feedback tract
   * effectors feeling tract

== Biological Reduction Rationale ==

  * reduction hierarchy contains only functions copied to aHuman
  * visual brain functions are regarded as generic sensory approach
  * motor is replaced by effector, movement is action
  * body remained as term, but its nature is completely different for aHuman
   * meaning for the mind is the same - default reward system and mandatory part for any action
   * hence somatosensory brain elements remained predefined mandatory sensor, body feeling.
  * single hemisphere is assumed to be enough
  * blood and heart are regarded as regulatory functions, controlling resources spent by brain

  * Biology data - 5 layers (plus 1 connectivity)
   * cells in columns have similar response properties
   * majority of connections are within layer
   * feed-forward connections are few but strong
   * layers 4 and 3 are primary feed-forward layers, layer 4 disappears if ascend hierarchy
  * Hypothesis
   * common mechanism in each layer
   * each layer is a sequence memory - learns transitions of sparse distributed patterns
   * layer 4 learns first order transitions - spacial inference, simple cells
   * layer 3 learns variable order transitions - time-based inference, complex cells
   * layer 5 motor
   * layers 2,6 - feedback, attention
   * all column cells fire when not predicted
  * Real neuron
   * proximity dendrites - linear summation, feed-forward, Nx100 synapses
   * distal dendrites - dozens of regions, non-linear integration, lateral connections, Nx1K synapses
   * ongoing forming and unforming of synapses
   * variable spike rate

- MCA.MC neurons fire 5-100 msec before the onset of a movement
- MCA.MC encodes the force of individual movements, but not individual muscles
- MCA.MC encodes the direction of movement
- MCA.MC encodes the extent of movement
- MCA.MC neurons encode the speed of movement

- MCA.PMC neurons signal the preparation for movement
- MCA.PMC neurons signal various sensory aspects associated with particular motor acts
- MCA.PMC is sensitive to the behavioral context of a particular movement
- MCA.PMC signals correct and incorrect actions

- MCA.SMC responds to sequences of movements and to mental rehearsal of sequences of movements
- MCA.SMC is involved in the transformation of kinematic to dynamic information

- posterior parietal cortex is involved in ensuring that movements 
  are targeted accurately to objects in external space
- prefrontal cortex is involved in the selection of appropriate actions 
  for a particular behavioral context
- lower motor neurons (alpha motor neurons) encode the force of individual muscles

- S1/BA3a - Muscle stretch receptors
- S1/BA3b - Skin, slowly adapting receptors
- S1/BA1 - Skin, rapidly adapting receptors
- S1/BA2 - Skin, complex touch - pressure and joint position

*Component items*:
  * *Genitalia* (*TARGET.TEA.GENITALIA*)
   * *Genitalia - sensations* (*genitalia-sensory*): sexual sensations
   * *Genitalia - sensations* (*genitalia-sensory*): sexual sensations
  * *Genitalia* (*TARGET.TEA.GENITALIA*)
   * *Genitalia - urination and support muscles* (*genitalia-urination*): in males, empties the urethra; in females, clenches the vagina
   * *Genitalia - urination and support muscles* (*genitalia-urination*): controls urine flow and contracts during orgasm
  * *Genitalia* (*TARGET.TEA.GENITALIA*)
   * *Genitalia - erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection*): stabilize the erect penis or (in females) tense the vagina during orgasm
   * *Genitalia - erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection*)
    * *Genitalia - man erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection-man*): penile erection; simultaneously the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa restricting the egress and circulation of this blood
   * *Genitalia - erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection*)
    * *Genitalia - woman erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection-woman*): contraction of smooth muscles of myometrium, decreased blood flow, loss of erection
    * *Genitalia - woman erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection-woman*): female - contraction of smooth muscles of myometrium, increased blood flow; sexual response by directing blood flow to the pelvis and to the external genitalia, including the ovaries, vagina, labia, and clitoris
    * *Genitalia - woman erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection-woman*): vasoconstriction of fibromuscular tube, loss of erection
    * *Genitalia - woman erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection-woman*): female - contraction of smooth muscles of myometrium, increased blood flow
    * *Genitalia - woman erection muscles* (*genitalia-erection-woman*): clitoral erection; simultaneously the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa restricting the egress and circulation of this blood
  * *Genitalia* (*TARGET.TEA.GENITALIA*)
   * *Genitalia - ejaculation muscles and glands, pregnancy and lifecycle support* (*genitalia-ejaculation*)
    * *Genitalia - man ejaculation muscles and glands* (*genitalia-ejaculation-man*): produces a clear, salty, viscous secretion known as pre-ejaculate, homologous to Bartholin glands in females
    * *Genitalia - man ejaculation muscles and glands* (*genitalia-ejaculation-man*): secrete a slightly alkaline fluid, milky or white in appearance, constitutes 50-75 percents of the volume of the semen along with spermatozoa and seminal vesicle fluid
    * *Genitalia - man ejaculation muscles and glands* (*genitalia-ejaculation-man*): male - emission (prior to ejaculation), contracts, propelling sperm forward
    * *Genitalia - man ejaculation muscles and glands* (*genitalia-ejaculation-man*): fixation of central tendon of perineum, support of pelvic floor, expulsion of semen in males and last drops of urine in both sexes
   * *Genitalia - ejaculation muscles and glands, pregnancy and lifecycle support* (*genitalia-ejaculation*)
    * *Genitalia - woman ejaculation muscles and glands* (*genitalia-ejaculation-woman*): secretes mucus to lubricate the vagina
    * *Genitalia - woman ejaculation muscles and glands* (*genitalia-ejaculation-woman*): cause female ejaculation and G-Spot orgasms
    * *Genitalia - woman ejaculation muscles and glands* (*genitalia-ejaculation-woman*): female - produces cervical mucus that changes in consistency during the menstrual cycle to prevent or promote pregnancy
    * *Genitalia - woman ejaculation muscles and glands* (*genitalia-ejaculation-woman*): fixation of central tendon of perineum, support of pelvic floor and last drops of urine in both sexes
  * *Genitalia* (*TARGET.TEA.GENITALIA*)
   * *Genitalia - scrotum muscles* (*genitalia-scrotum-muscles*): raise and lower the scrotum, acts quickly, it is a reflex
   * *Genitalia - scrotum muscles* (*genitalia-scrotum-muscles*): corrugates the scrotum; contraction reduces the surface area available for heat loss, thus reducing heat loss and warming the testicles; expansion increases the surface area, promoting heat loss and thus cooling the testicles.

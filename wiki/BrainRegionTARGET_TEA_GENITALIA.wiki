*Component items*:
  * *Genitalia - urination and support muscles (genitalia-urination)*
   * *Genitalia - bulbospongiosus muscle (bulbospongiosus-muscle)*: in males, empties the urethra; in females, clenches the vagina
   * *Genitalia - external sphincter muscle of female urethra (external-sphincter-female-urethra)*: control urination, constricts urethra, maintain urinary continence
   * *Genitalia - external sphincter muscle of male urethra (external-sphincter-male-urethra)*: control urination, constricts urethra, maintain urinary continence
   * *Genitalia - pubococcygeus muscle (pubococcygeus-muscle)*: controls urine flow and contracts during orgasm
  * *Genitalia - erection muscles (genitalia-erection)*
   * *Genitalia - parasympathetic uterus vasodilators (uterus-parasympathetic)*: female - contraction of smooth muscles of myometrium, increased blood flow; sexual response by directing blood flow to the pelvis and to the external genitalia, including the ovaries, vagina, labia, and clitoris
   * *Genitalia - parasympathetic vaginal vasodilators (vagina-parasympathetic)*: female - contraction of smooth muscles of myometrium, increased blood flow
   * *Genitalia - corpus cavernosum clitoridis (corpus-cavernosum-clitoridis)*: clitoral erection; simultaneously the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa restricting the egress and circulation of this blood
   * *Genitalia - corpus cavernosum penis (corpus-cavernosum-penis)*: penile erection; simultaneously the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa restricting the egress and circulation of this blood
   * *Genitalia - ischiocavernosus muscle (ischiocavernosus-muscle)*: stabilize the erect penis or (in females) tense the vagina during orgasm
   * *Genitalia - uterus, sympathetic contractors (uterus-sympathetic)*: contraction of smooth muscles of myometrium, decreased blood flow, loss of erection
   * *Genitalia - vagina, sympathetic vasoconstrictors (vagina-sympathetic)*: vasoconstriction of fibromuscular tube, loss of erection
  * *Genitalia - ejaculation muscles and glands, pregnancy and lifecycle support (genitalia-ejaculation)*
   * *Genitalia - bartholin gland (bartholin-gland)*: secretes mucus to lubricate the vagina
   * *Genitalia - cowper gland (cowper-gland)*: produces a clear, salty, viscous secretion known as pre-ejaculate, homologous to Bartholin glands in females
   * *Genitalia - prostate gland (prostate-gland)*: secrete a slightly alkaline fluid, milky or white in appearance, constitutes 50–75 percents of the volume of the semen along with spermatozoa and seminal vesicle fluid
   * *Genitalia - skenes gland (skenes-gland)*: cause female ejaculation and G-Spot orgasms
   * *Genitalia - cervix (cervix-gland)*: female - produces cervical mucus that changes in consistency during the menstrual cycle to prevent or promote pregnancy
   * *Genitalia - testicle gland (testicle-gland)*: produce androgens, primarily testosterone (growth of muscle mass and strength, regulator of cognitive and physical energy, sperm development
   * *Genitalia - ovary gland (ovary-gland)*: secretes estrogen (maturation and maintenance of the reproductive organs), testosterone (prepares the uterus for pregnancy, and the mammary glands for lactation) and progesterone (promoting menstrual cycle changes in the endometrium
   * *Genitalia - vas deferens (vas-deferens)*: male - emission (prior to ejaculation), contracts, propelling sperm forward
   * *Genitalia - deep transverse perineal muscle, penis (deep-transverse-perineal-muscle-penis)*: fixation of central tendon of perineum, support of pelvic floor, expulsion of semen in males and last drops of urine in both sexes
   * *Genitalia - deep transverse perineal muscle, clitoris (deep-transverse-perineal-muscle-clitoris)*: fixation of central tendon of perineum, support of pelvic floor and last drops of urine in both sexes
  * *Genitalia - sensations (genitalia-sensory)*
   * *Genitalia - utetovaginal visceral receptors (utetovaginal-visceral-receptors)*: sexual sensations
   * *Genitalia - visceral sexual receptors (visceral-sexual-receptors)*: sexual sensations
  * *Genitalia - scrotum muscles (genitalia-scrotum-muscles)*
   * *Genitalia - cremaster muscle (cremaster-muscle)*: raise and lower the scrotum, acts quickly, it is a reflex
   * *Genitalia - dartos muscle (dartos-muscle)*: corrugates the scrotum; contraction reduces the surface area available for heat loss, thus reducing heat loss and warming the testicles; expansion increases the surface area, promoting heat loss and thus cooling the testicles.

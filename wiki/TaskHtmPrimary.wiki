#summary Implement working model of HTM

@@[Home] -> [ReleasePlanning] -> [TaskHtmPrimary]
----

== What ==

  * discover features potentially supported by HTM
  * specify interface for HTM in current framework
  * integrate any existing Open Source implementation into framework
  * choose sample task: computer vision or narrative understanding from real chat
  * make working demo implementation for sample task

== How ==

  * Currently openCV library from INTEL is being researched on to see if we can integrate it into our HTM module

== Architecture ==

http://www.scielo.org.za/img/revistas/sajs/v105n9-10/a14fig04.gif

  * libbn will be developed based on the architecture shown above.

== Implementation ==

  * libbn will be a generic library that can be integrated into any module using a adaptation layer.
  * For computer vision this adaptation layer will be implemented using openCV library that will get the image data and feed it to the HTM network for creating ahuman memory.

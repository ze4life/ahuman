== What is sensor ==

  * no single agreed answer
  * it has inputs from world external to brain - e.g. gets senses of body or rainbow colors
  * it has outputs inside brain, provinding the only inputs for its activity, including cases when sense generated mind activity which, in turn, generated another mind activity
  * frog from one research has unconditonal reflexes inborn in the eye
  * it generally has receptors and nerve system to transfer information and control receptors, in other words nerve system adopts (models) received sensor data, which can be named a sort of processing

== Sensor functions ==

==== Capture inputs ====

  * external world doesn't have information flow adopted to aHuman
  * sensor selects some external world features

==== Focus =====

  * consider child reading book by letters and adult human reading text by words or even by sentenses
  * adult can read word by both letters and words, while child can only by letters. How it occurs?

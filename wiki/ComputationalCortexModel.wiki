== Thoughts ==

  * consider sequence - word "concatenation"
   * sequences are based on emotional stressing - con-cate-nation
   * consider you start hearing "ncate"
   * you will ignore "n" as it could be part of "in category"
   * you will surely map "cate" to strong subsequence
   * so your expected word will be "cate-gory"
   * you will recognise "(con)-cate-nation" - after hearing "nation" - like you go to wrong direction then confused and returned to the forked way
  * consider similarity between invariant representation in neocortex and error function as content of feed-forward flow
   * invariant representation of auditory information - relative intervals, not absolute notes are stored and recognized

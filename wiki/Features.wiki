This page is a place for features already implemented in aHuman project modules.
Modular approach for aHuman is chosen so that modules explain how functionality is split into relatively independent groups. Modules are re-using common libraries, established as a core of aHuman.

== Top Features ==

*Mind:*

  * pure software platform to implement brain processes with neural and non-neural elements
  * cortex building block paradigm where all the mind, except framework and libraries, is represented by a set of interconnected neural of belief networks, each network is a kind of abstract Cortex object
  * allows integration of several incompatible implementations of neural networks and belief networks and using them in different cortexes

*Technical*

  * extendable application components framework
  * finalised well-tested execution wrapper
  * unlimited configurable TCP/IP-based gates from external world to internal messaging system
  * configurable logging
  * controlled and configurable multi-threading
  * lifecycle control for components
  * controlling CPU load

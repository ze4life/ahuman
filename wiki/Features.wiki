This page is a place for features already implemented in aHuman project modules.
Modular approach for aHuman is chosen so that modules explain how functionality is split into relatively independent groups. Modules are re-using common libraries, established as a core of aHuman.

== Top Features ==

*Mind:*

  * pure software platform to implement brain processes with neural and non-neural elements
  * cortex building block paradigm where all the mind, except framework and libraries, is represented by a set of interconnected neural of belief networks, each network is a kind of abstract Cortex object
  * allows integration of several incompatible implementations of neural networks and belief networks and using them in different cortexes

== Platform ==

  * extendable application components framework
  * finalised well-tested execution wrapper
  * unlimited configurable TCP/IP-based gates from external world to internal messaging system
  * configurable logging
  * controlled and configurable multi-threading
  * lifecycle control for components
  * controlling CPU load

== Mind Modules ==

  * [MindTargetFeatures] - final application with specific sensors and effectors
  * [MindServiceFeatures] - overall mind management
  * [MindAreaFeatures] - mind area and its lifecycle
  * [MindRegionFeatures] - supporting types of cortex and nuclei architecture
  * [MindMatterFeatures] - software representation of neural networks
  * [MindFrameworkFeatures] - supporting interaction of mind modules

== Framework and Libraries ==

  * [frameworkFeatures] - Framework
  * [nnlibFeatures] - Neural Networks Libraries
  * [bnlibFeatures] - Belief Networks Libraries
  * [svcioFeatures] - Internal Messaging Service
  * [svcdbFeatures] - Persistance Service
  * [genrtnlibFeatures] - Generic Library

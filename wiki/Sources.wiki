==Repository Contents==

googlecode repository consists of:

  * codebase of high level architecture (HLA) version branches ($HOME/trunk_HLAv2, $HOME/trunk_HLAv3)
  * external code used with related materials - their headers and built libs are commited to trunk_HLAv3/library and used from there; if something should be changed in externals - you need to update externals, make build there, and commit resulting library to current HLA branch ($HOME/externals)
  * research area - place to commit various articles and documents, arranging them in a systematic manner ($HOME/research)
  * storage of diagrams and pictures copied from varied sources to make it constantly available, as well as own aHuman content created manually or generated using graphviz ($HOME/images)

Repository Contents

Entire Subversion repository is related to code. All the documentation is on Wiki Pages.

Top-level Subversion directories contain:

branches
    Stable baseline of sources. All the sub-projects are released simultaneously once per quarter and branches are named appropriately. It represents "Time Window" iterative development approach - see Development Cycle for details. Only quarterly releases branches are there. Latest branch is supported within next quarter - only critical bugfixes are implemented. Bugfixes require immediate merge into mainline (sources). 

builds
    All the distributives for internal libraries, opposed to third-party (external) libraries (see externals). See Development Cycle to understand how manage distributives. Complete distributives covering all the Human project are located in Files and exist for all yearly quarters, no matter how many new features have been added. 

externals
    All third-party distributives, being used "as is", without customising. Customised distributives are regarded as internal libraries and stored in sources. Though you need to reference original distributive on Development Environment in Third Party Projects section. 

research
    There can be both branches from mainline/stable releases or standalone development trees. Please read Research Cycle on how to arrange code in these directories. Its contents is quite non-restricted, but we need easily to identify related research activity described in Neural Networks Research or Artificial Intelligence Research. No direct merging expected from these branches to mainline. Research activity does not have the goal to create the working code. It is intended to create an algorithm or prove certain idea (i.e. prototyping), or to calculate performance characteristics or something else like that. 

sources
    This is the mainline (trunk, long-term development branch), where all the current feature development occurs. It does not cover research, where could be also certain coding activities for prototyping or something like that. Opposite to branches and tags, it exists in one instance over the all Human project life. See Development Cycle to see when and what activities are expected in mainline. Scope of current development is presented on Mainline Development. 

tags
    Any fixed version of any application or library. Always has corresponding entry in builds. Not intended for amending, which is opposite to any branch in branches where changes are permitted and lead to new versions. Tags and branches are very cheap and fast in Subversions, so can be used intensively. 

Stable Code

The latest code committed to project repository can be found in sources - it is what I name Mainline Development. Of course it is not stable code and the code not assigned to clear feature set. To find latest stable branch - open branches and find directory for latest quarter. E.g. if now is July, 2009, then check for 2009Q2 directory. Any branch in branches has the same structure as sources.
How To

    * Create root folder for Human project and run there below command: 

{{{
svn checkout https://ahuman.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ human --username vsavchik --password <password>
}}}

    * After successful downloading sources run below command for any file and check no errors occurs: 

 svn log <file>

    * Now you can open engine application - open corresponding project (sources/engine/engine.dsp) using VC++ and execute Build All.

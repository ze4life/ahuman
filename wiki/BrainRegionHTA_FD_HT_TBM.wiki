This page covers biological details of component Tuberomammillary Nucleus.
Region is part of aHuman target integrated biological model.

  * *Top-down path to region*: Forebrain Diencephalon -> Hypothalamus (HTA.FD.HT) -> Lateral Hypothalamic Area (HTA.FD.HT.LT) -> Lateral Tuberal Nuclei (HTA.FD.HT.LTUB) -> Tuberomammillary Nucleus (HTA.FD.HT.TBM) (see [OverallMindMaps Mind Maps])
  * *Type*: nucleus
  * *Brain area*: [BrainAreaLAC Lower Brain - Autonomous Control Area]
  * *Role*: relay
  * *Function*: sole source of histamine in the brain
  * *Notes to function*: regulate sleep, helps produce responses to sexual stimuli, and helps body respond to stressful situations

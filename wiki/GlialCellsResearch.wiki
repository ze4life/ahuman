== Meaning of Glial Cell ==

  * glial cells spare 65% of mind volume
  * the same count as neurons (but keep in mind Albert Einstein who had enormous number of glial cells, that maybe affected his mental metabolism)
  * glial cells don't have synapses and electrical signals
  * glial cells absorb extra GLU neurotransmitter with autoreceptors when GLU is flowed into intracell space, and convert it to GABA, regulating optimal excitatory/inhibitory ratio

== Functions ==

  * surround and physically support neurons 
  * direct neurons to final location in initial brain development
  * feed neurons
  * extract neurotransmitters from synaptic cleft of neurons
  * release modulatory neurotransmitters
  * remove dead neurons
  * able to regenerate broken link after critical period

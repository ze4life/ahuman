This paper proposes how each region of neocortex might
learn the sequences necessary for this theory.

== Hierarchical Memory Models ==

  * *Spatial only*: Convolutional Neural Networks (Le Cun & Bengio) - 1995; HMAX (Riesenhuber & Poggio) - 1999
  * *Temporal*: HHMM - hierarchical hidden Markov model (Fine et al.) - 1998
  * *Spatial and Temporal*: HTM (Numenta) - 2005

== Biological Constraints ==

Requirements that a biological sequence memory must meet, which are different from linear computer memory.

  * Probabilistic prediction
  * Simultaneous learning and recall
  * Auto-associative recall
  * Variable-order memory
  * Biological constraints

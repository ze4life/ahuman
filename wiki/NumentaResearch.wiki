This paper proposes how each region of neocortex might
learn the sequences necessary for this theory.

== Hierarchical Memory Models ==

  * *Spatial only*: Convolutional Neural Networks (Le Cun & Bengio) - 1995; HMAX (Riesenhuber & Poggio) - 1999
  * *Temporal*: HHMM - hierarchical hidden Markov model (Fine et al.) - 1998
  * *Spatial and Temporal*: HTM (Numenta) - 2005

== Biological Constraints ==

Requirements that a biological sequence memory must meet, which are different from linear computer memory.

  * *Probabilistic prediction* - input and prediction are probability distributions
  * *Simultaneous learning and recall* - simultaneously recalling and predicting
  * *Auto-associative recall* - recognize sequences even if it is presented with a partial sequence from the middle of a previously learned sequence; naturally auto-associative
  * *Variable-order memory* - ‘ABCDE’ and ‘YBCDZ’ - correctly predict the last element of the sequence based on an input that occurred many time steps earlier; the internal representation of an afferent pattern must change depending on the temporal context in which it occurs; the representation for the elements ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ must be somehow different when preceded by ‘A’ than by ‘Y’

== Services == 

  * NeuroLink implements bundle of fibers
   * each fiber corresponds to part of axon starting after initial axon segment (which can be modulated by connection) and includes all axon endings, while dendrite with its receptors is part of NeuroPool (set of neurons)
   * one fiber is connected to the only source neuron
   * one fiber is connected to the set of destination neurons topologically close to each other (receptive field)
  * NeuroLink connects one NeuroPool to another NeuroPool
   * signal flows across NeuroLink in one direction
   * source NeuroPool and destination NeuroPool can be of the same or of different MindRegion
  * NeuroLink implements neurotransmitter which affects:
   * transmission speed
   * affected receptors
   * receptor thresholds

== Implementation == 

  * NeuroLink uses the same neurotransmitter for all fibers
  * one event - one transmission across all fibers
   * activation blocks fired axon branch for a certain time
   * NeuroLink does not store any connection - only properties of mapping
  * each destination cell has equivalent receptive field - representing set of incoming fibers
   * strength of connections (weights) is part of [Neuron] information but not NeuroLink

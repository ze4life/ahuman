# People contributed 2009 - 2012 #

**Sarbjit Singh**:

I am Sarbjit Singh ,a programmer by profession and have 5 years experience (in 2009) in software industry. I always wanted to make a breakthrough in the software world and I think its a opportunity in which we can change the way world lives, the way we get information, the way we learn. AI has lot of potential and we can exploit this to create some interesting things. I am willing to share my experience in industry if some one needs it. sarbjit.longia@gmail.com

**Quentin Valdeyron**

I am currently 4th year Epitech student, fascinate by complex machines and human reasoning. Ahuman appears to me as the way to merge both of these. I worked on man-machine interaction before realizing that we are actually able to do better than a simple interface between one world to another. I am hoping that A.L will take us to a deeper understanding of human fonctionning which could be the beginning of an healthier world.
If someone wanna share on the subject. ergo.quentin@gmail.com

**Subhayan Roy Moulick**

I have always been fascinated by the "intelligence" of an organic life form, their techniques of decision making and interaction with the environment. This through the years have also got me interested in the field of ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, one that can be created. However when we think about it in a very simple way, i think its not that different from ours, we tend to LEARN "things" and the appropriate use of the "things" we have LEARNT is used to determine the INTELLIGENCE.

aHuman project is very special because this tries to achieve the task of TEACHING a computer. And I am here just to achieve a common goal.
Also its approach through open sourcing it is praiseworthy and admirable.

I am always available at subhayan.rm@gmail.com

**Dmitry Dneprov**

I am a professional programmer and software architect.
Complex chalenges such as AI
are of special interest for me.
My hobby is constructing
useful robots and smart home automation. I think AI will bring it to
completely new level.

ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------------------------
engine
	- whole creature life functions
	- generic application services

libbn
	- belief networks of different types
	- implement neurex abstraction as belief network

libbn
	- neural networks of different types
	- implement neurex abstraction as neural network

modbody
	- biology/capture software process characteristics as body signals
	- biology/gormone factory and feelings
	- sensors/produce raw sensor flow
	- effectors/pre-defined sets of actions in environment
	- physiology/direct feedback to effectors from environment
	- physiology/inborn unconditional reflexes

modbrain
	- neurex-to-neurex linking
	- keep overall multi-neurex map
	- thinking as activation of selected neurexes
	- memory decay

modcognition
	- cortex/transform raw sensor flow item into set of features
	- cortex/long-term memory for input patterns
	- associations/hebbian associations of different order among features
	- associations/mental state as short-term memory for activated features

modintelligence
	- behavior/learning temporal sequences of features
	- behavior/predict expected features and activate them in associative memory
	- behavior/generate intentions based on features controlled by feelings
	- behavior/generate higher order intentions based on lower-order intentions in case of inefficiency of learned low-level strategy
	- motor/produce actions by intentions controlled by feelings

modknowledge
	- ready-to-use non-neural knowledge
	- providing neural interface to non-neural knowledge

modmedia
	- facades for external media access libraries/connectors
	- physical access to external environment

svcio
	- channel management for external flows
	- managing internal data flows
	- support for commands and data streams

svcdb
	- object persistance
	- swapping neural networks

ALPHA ISSUES AND TODO
----------------------------------------------

TODO IN PROGRESS
---------------------
	modnnlib: 
		Make neural networking library be able to solve generic (arbitrary 
		number of inputs/outputs) approximation	problem, generic classification 
		problem.
	modio:
		Add admin command interface - no YACC processing
